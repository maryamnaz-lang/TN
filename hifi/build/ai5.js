   THE MODULE HEAD IS ONE BAND
   Figma 292:288.

   Every module's landing page opens with the same four things: where you
   are (crumb), what this page is (the header and its description), what Tal
   has to say about it, and the line you can ask Tal something in. Until now
   those were four sections stacked on the canvas with a hairline between
   each — four separate objects that happened to be adjacent.

   Maryam's frame draws them as ONE thing: a single band carrying a warm
   gradient wash, closed by a single rule that runs edge to edge. The wash
   is what says "this part of the page is the assistant"; the rule is what
   says where that part stops. Both only read as one surface if the members
   are one element, so this pass wraps them.

   WHY A PASS AND NOT MARKUP. The ask line does not exist in the view: it is
   injected by `placeAsk` in ai4.js after the view has rendered. So the band
   cannot be assembled by the view layer — the last member has not arrived
   yet. It has to happen after ai4's pass, which is exactly where this one
   sits. It also means one edit covers all nine landing pages rather than
   nine edits covering one each, and a page that gains or loses a Tal card
   needs no further work.

   The required action rides the Tal head row. `.ai-do` is Tal's own button
   and it sat under the sentence; the frame puts it at the right-hand end of
   the row Tal's name is on, because it is the one thing you would do about
   what Tal just said, and a required action belongs at the top of the block
   that required it. It is genuinely optional — most Tal cards offer a
   question instead — so the class that opens a third grid track is added
   only when there is a button to put in it. See the trap in the handover:
   `.agh` grew a phantom third column exactly this way.
   ========================================================================== */

/* a member of the band: the crumb if it leads, the page header, a Tal
   section if the page has one, and the ask line if ai4 placed one */
/* `.ask-chips` is a row of suggested questions with no card around it — what
   Tal's card offers, on a page that has no card. Points is the only page that
   draws one (see the note in `V.rewards`), and without this it fell out of the
   band and read as the first block of the page body. */

     Stop at the first section that is neither Tal, the ask line, nor a section
     the view has DECLARED as head furniture — that one is the body of the page
     and the rule goes above it.

     `.head-sec` IS THAT DECLARATION, AND IT IS OPT-IN FOR A REASON. Everything
     else this loop takes is recognised by what it contains (`_mhIsTal` looks
     for Tal's mark), because Tal's card and the ask line are the same object on
     every page that has one. A third member is not: the Enroll page puts the
     cohort leader under Tal's sentence because on THAT page the person is part
     of the answer to "what am I buying", and no rule about markup could work
     that out. So the view says so, and the band takes it in the order the view
     printed it.

     IT STILL HAS TO SIT DIRECTLY AFTER THE HEADER. The loop is a run, not a
     search — a `.head-sec` with the page body between it and the `.ph` is left
     where it is, which is the right answer: it is not at the head of the page.
     Tal's own card is inserted after the `.ph` later (`placePageSummary`), so a
     `.head-sec` written second in the view comes out THIRD in the band, under
     the sentence. That ordering is load-bearing and is why the view writes it
     immediately after `ph()` rather than where it reads in the page. */
  /* AND IT TAKES AT MOST ONE TAL SECTION, WHICH IS A REAL BUG THIS RUN HAD.
     `_mhIsTal` recognises a member by CONTENT — anything containing `.ai-aura`
     or `.ai-label` — and there is exactly one Tal card at the head of a page,
     so for twenty-odd views the difference never showed. The AI-native
     dashboard (§70) puts "Tal's recommends" directly under the band as a
     `.sec` with an `.ai-label.bare` on it, and the run walked straight into
     it: the recommendation went into the band, landed in the left column at
     576px instead of the page's 901, and the photograph, the facts and the
     two actions each wrapped onto a line of their own. Nothing threw and
     nothing warned — the section was simply somewhere else.

     One is the right cap and not a guess: the band's left column is "title,
     facts, hairline, wing, hairline, TAL" (§56) and Tal is the last of those
     by construction, so a second Tal-marked section after it is a section of
     the page, whatever it contains. A view that genuinely wants one more
     member up there says so with `.head-sec`, which is what that opt-in is
     for and which still runs on either side of this. */
  /* AND `no-band` IS THE OPT-OUT, WHICH IS `head-sec` TURNED ROUND.

     `head-sec` exists because some members cannot be recognised by what they
     contain, so the view declares them. This is the mirror: a section that
     LOOKS like Tal's card to `_mhIsTal` and is not one. `talRec` is the case —
     it wears an `.ai-label.bare` for "Agent recommended by Tal", so the run
     claims it, and §70's own note records what that looked like on the `new`
     dashboard (the whole recommendation laid out in the band's left column at
     576px instead of the page's 901, nothing thrown and nothing warned).

     WHAT WAS PROTECTING IT WAS THE ONE-TAL CAP ABOVE, AND ONLY BY ACCIDENT.
     On that dashboard Tal's summary card is written first, so `tal` is already
     true by the time the run reaches the recommendation. On a MODULE page it is
     not: `placePageSummary` (ai6) inserts the summary card two passes after
     this one, so at this moment the recommendation is the first member after
     the `.ph` and the cap is unarmed. `V.interviews` draws exactly that.

     `break` RATHER THAN `continue`, because the run is a run: a section the
     band must not have is also the end of the band. */

   A BLACK CARD BELONGS AGAINST THE HEAD, WHEREVER IT IS

   The dark card is this product's one loud object. Every page has at most one
   and it is always the same kind of thing: the required action (book the
   re-interview, join the call), the fact the page exists to state (your level,
   your certificate), or the one offer it carries. A page can only have one
   loudest thing, so where that thing sits is not a per-page decision — it
   goes directly under the module head, and the two read as one opening block.

   Most pages already drew it there and a handful did not, which is the whole
   reason this is a pass rather than a set of edits:

     week1, day90, promoted dashboards   the achievement banner sat between
                                         the band and the card. A dismissible
                                         notice was pushing the page's
                                         required action below the fold —
                                         and dismissing it changed where the
                                         card sat, which is how the same
                                         dashboard came to look like two
                                         different layouts.
     account                             the leader wall was fourth.
     transcript                          the certificate was last.

   MEMBERSHIP, NOT JUST ORDER. The card goes INSIDE the band, as its last
   member, and takes the band's own content padding — so it is inset to the
   spine the description and the chips sit on, with the wash showing to its
   left, to its right and below it. An earlier cut of this only reordered:
   the card sat immediately AFTER the band, full-bleed to the page's edges,
   butted against the band's closing rule. That reads as two blocks that
   happen to touch. Inside, inset, on the wash, it reads as what it is — the
   last thing the head of the page has to say, which is the one thing to do
   about everything above it.

   A DARK CARD IS FULL-BLEED BY DEFAULT and stops being so in here: §25.12
   takes the negative margins off, so the card pays the gutter its host
   section pays and keeps its own internal padding on top of that. That is
   the two-step inset the frame draws — card edge on the band's spine, card
   text one gutter further in.

   THE ANCHOR IS THE BAND, and where there is no band it is the crumb: on a
   sub-page with no header there is nothing to be a member of, so the card
   follows the crumb instead — the same relationship one level down.

   A BARE CARD GETS A SECTION. Most dark cards are already wrapped in a `.sec`
   that carries the gutter; the level card is a child of the page itself. It
   is wrapped here so every member of the band is inset by the same rule
   rather than by two.

   Idempotent by position: if the host already ends the band there is nothing
   to do, so the pass survives running on a page it has already arranged —
   which it does, on every render.
   ========================================================================== */
/* `.ldr-read` — the competency read on a level decision — is a card class
   INSIDE its section rather than a `.sec` variant, and that is what keeps it
   out of the wrapping branch below: a host that matches this list is wrapped
   in a fresh `.sec` (the branch `.lvl-hero` needs, having no section of its
   own), and a `.sec` wrapped in a `.sec` pays the gutter twice. */
const DARK_CARD = '.plate, .cert, .sec.on-dark, .score.on-dark, .lead-b, .lvl-hero, .ldr-read';

/* AND IT STANDS DOWN WHERE THE JOURNEY HAS THE COLUMN — §70.3.
   The band's second column holds one thing. On the three pre-enrolment
   dashboards that thing is now the four steps, so a plate lifted into the band
   would land in column ONE, stacked under Tal's sentence, in a slot sized for
   a paragraph. Left where the view printed it, it is the first section of the
   page body — which is exactly where it was before §56 pulled it up, and still
   the right place for it: on `booked` it is the Join, on `assessed` it is the
   enrolment offer, and both read fine full-width under the band.

   TESTED ON THE PAGE, NOT ON THE STAGE. `.head-col` is what declares "the second
   column is spoken for", so a page that adopts the AI-native head gets the same
   answer without being named here — which is exactly what happened: §71 put the
   progress strip in that column on the three enrolled dashboards and needed no
   edit in this function beyond the class it tests.

   THE CLASS USED TO BE `.sec-jrn` AND THE RENAME IS THE WHOLE OF THE CHANGE.
   §70 gated the two-column band on the journey list by name because there was
   one tenant; there are two now — `.sec-jrn` and `.sec-prog` — so `.head-col`
   is the structural half and the other two say only WHICH tenant. §70.3 and

   THE PLATE READS TOP DOWN: WHAT IT IS, WHEN, WHO

   Every plate in the build was drawn in the order it was written, and that
   order was wrong in the same way six times: the PERSON came first. A 56px
   photograph and a name at the top of the card, then the eyebrow, then the
   title. So the first thing you read on "Cohort 41, week 13" was "Priya Nair,
   cohort leader" — the least changing fact on the card, at its loudest point,
   above the thing the card is actually about.

   The order now:

     .plate-h     the label and, at the far right, WHEN. One row.
     .plate-t     what this is — the title
     .plate-b     the detail line: time, how many others, how long
     .plate-a     what you would do about it (column two at desktop)
     .plate-who   the person, last

   WHO GOES LAST BECAUSE IT IS CONTEXT, NOT NEWS. The face is worth having —
   it says a real person is running this — but it answers "who" and you only
   ask that after "what" and "when". Same chunk, same composition, moved.

   THE TIMER LEAVES THE EYEBROW. `plate-eb` was carrying two different things
   joined by a middot: a label ("Weekly call", "Booked", "Next up") and a
   distance in time ("in 2 days", "today 4:30 pm"). The first is a category
   and the second is the one value on the card that changes by itself, so they
   are not one line. The distance moves to the card's top-right corner, where
   a live value belongs and where the eye lands after the title; the label
   stays where it was.

   SPLIT AT THE FIRST MIDDOT, and a plate with no middot keeps its whole
   eyebrow as the label. That is deliberate rather than incidental: "Next up"
   and "Due now" are states, not distances, and promoting either into a timer
   slot would put a word where a clock is expected.

   A PASS AND NOT SIX EDITS, for the same reason `placeBand` is one: the six
   plates live in views.js and lead.js, three of them behind stage branches,
   and the composition is one component's business. This also picks up any
   plate a later page adds without that page having to know the order.
   ========================================================================== */
/* THE DETAIL LINE IS A LIST, AND EACH ITEM WEARS ITS OWN MARK.
   `.plate-b` is written as one `&middot;` run — "Thursday at 6:00 PM ET · 9
   others · 60 minutes" — which is three different facts (a date, a headcount, a
   duration) told as one sentence. It held together while the card ran the width
   of the page; in §56's column the run wraps to two and three lines and the
   middots land mid-line, so the one thing on the card you actually need to act
   on is the hardest part of it to read.

   Split at the middots, one row each, a 16px mark in front. Same table shape
   and the same first-match-wins order as `stepIcon` and `factIcon` in views.js,
   and the same argument for deriving it: six plates across two portals and a
   seventh whenever a page adds an appointment.

   ON EVERY PLATE, NOT ONLY THE ONE IN THE COLUMN. Every plate in the product is
   moved into the head band by `placeDark` below, so "the narrow one" is all of
   them at desktop; and below 900, where the card is full width, the column it

/* AND A ROW THAT ENDS ON A FIGURE IS A LABEL AND A VALUE.
   "Course price <b>$690</b>" is not the same shape as "60 minutes": it is a
   question and its answer, and the answer is the reason the row is on the card.
   Read as one run it sat mid-line with 90px of white after it, which on the
   enrolment card put the one number the reader came for in the least prominent
   place on the row.

   THE TEST IS A `<b>` AT THE END OF THE PART, and it is deliberately that
   narrow. Lifted out it becomes a flex sibling rather than a word inside the
   label, which is the only way §66 can push it to the row's right edge — and
   §66's rules for the list (a hairline under each row) key on `.plate-v` too,
   so "does this list have a labelled figure in it" is what decides whether the
   four facts are drawn as a spec or as a paragraph in four parts. A `<b>` in
   the MIDDLE of a fact is emphasis inside a sentence and stays where it is.

   ONE CALL SITE TODAY — `enrolPlate`'s price — and the rule generalises with no
   further work: any plate that writes a fact as `Label <b>figure</b>` gets the
   figure on the right in the accent. `.plate-v` is what §63 states the accent
   ink for, so a plate that wants a figure without one does not write a `<b>`.

   THE LABEL CAN BE EMPTY. A part that is nothing but `<b>$690</b>` is a figure
   with no question in front of it, and an empty `<span>` before it would eat
   the row's own gap; so the label span is written only when there are words. */
/* AND WHEN *EVERY* ROW ENDS ON A FIGURE, THE LIST IS AN INVOICE AND THE MARKS
   COME OFF. This is the same shape of argument as the one above and it is the
   other half of it.

   A mark in front of a fact says what KIND of thing the row is about — a
   wallet for the price, a book for the chapters, a group for the cohort — and
   it earns its 20px because the four rows are about four different things.
   The enrolment checkout's three are the fee, the credit and what is due, and
   `PLATE_IC` leads on money, so all three matched the same rule and the card
   came out with a column of three identical wallets saying "this row is about
   money" three times over a list whose every row is a number.

   THE TEST IS "IS THERE A ROW HERE THAT IS NOT A FIGURE", which is the honest
   condition and is why it is decided here rather than by a class the call site
   remembers. One labelled figure among plain facts is a spec and keeps its
   spine; nothing but labelled figures is a table of amounts, and a table does
   not need an icon per line. `enrolPlate`'s four — price, chapters,
   assessments, cohort — have three rows with no `<b>` in them and are
   untouched.

   IT HAS TO BE DECIDED BEFORE THE ROWS ARE BUILT, not after, because the mark
   is baked into each row's HTML. Hence the `every` over the parts rather than
   a `querySelectorAll` on the result. `.plate-tab` is what §69 rules the total
   off with and what §63 reads to keep the accent for the figure that is
   actually due; there is no CSS that can ask this question, since the
   quantifier it needs is a nested `:has()` and that is invalid. */

/* ==========================================================================
   THE BLACK WALL IS FOR THE THING THAT CANNOT WAIT

   Maryam's rule, and it is a rule about MEANING rather than about a card:
   black ground plus the warm haze off the top-right corner is the loudest
   object this product draws, and it should be spent on an action that is
   time-sensitive or wants attention now. A call today is that. A call on
   Thursday is not, and drawing the two the same way makes the loud one mean
   nothing — every dashboard in the build opened on a black wall, so the wall
   stopped being a signal and became the shape a plate is.

   TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IS THE LINE. Inside it the card is the black plate
   unchanged; outside it the same card is QUIET — the ground goes, the haze
   goes, the ink flips, and in the head band a vertical rule takes over the job
   the black edge was doing of saying where column one stops (§59). The card
   does not move, lose a fact or lose its buttons: the same content, one
   priority down. As the appointment comes inside the day it goes black on its
   own, because the only thing that decides is the distance in time.

   DERIVED FROM THE WORDS, BECAUSE THE WORDS ARE ALL THERE IS. Every
   appointment in this prototype is a hand-written string — `data-when="in 2
   days"`, "Weekly call &middot; thursday", "Today 4:30 PM" off `LEAD_SESSIONS`
   — and there is no clock behind any of them to subtract from. So the test is
   the vocabulary of "inside the day": now, today, tonight, starting, and any
   count of hours or minutes. Everything else — tomorrow, a weekday, a date, "in
   2 days" — is outside it. A real build swaps this one function for a date
   difference and nothing else in the file changes.

   THE LABEL COUNTS AS WELL AS THE CLOCK, and that is what makes "Due now" work.
   `placePlates` splits the eyebrow at the middot: "Weekly call · in 2 days"
   leaves a label and a time, but "Due now" has no middot and stays a label
   entirely. It is the most urgent thing either portal says and it would have
   read as quiet if only the timer slot were tested.

   AND A CARD WITH NO CLOCK AT ALL IS QUIET. Three plates carry no time because
   there is no appointment in them — the enrolment offer, and the two cards that
   explain what a level interview IS. None of them expires, which is the whole
   test. `data-urgent="1"` / `="0"` on the card overrides the reading for
   anything that needs to say so directly; nothing in the build does yet, which
   is why it is an attribute rather than a list of call sites here.

   ONLY `.plate`. `DARK_CARD` covers six components and the other five are not
   actions: `.cert` is an award, `.lvl-hero` a level, `.score` a table,
   `.ldr-read` a competency read. A quiet certificate would be a certificate
   with the ceremony taken off it, and none of the five has a deadline to be
   inside or outside. They keep their ground.

/* THE PATTERN ITSELF MOVED TO views.js AND IS READ FROM HERE — §71.
   599:7418 / 608:7772 draw the weekly cohort call as a light ROW with two
   grounds rather than as a plate with two priorities, and `callRow` has to pick
   between them while the VIEW is being built. A view cannot read a const this
   file declares: views.js's boot `render()` is the last statement in that file
   and runs before this one is parsed, so `#week1/dashboard` off the hash would
   reach `PLATE_SOON` in the temporal dead zone — the same hazard the note over
   `COHORT_LEAD` records for `LEADER`.

   So it is declared once, in the file that parses first, and both readers point
   at it. Which matters more than the ordering: the row and the plate now decide
   "is this inside the day" two files apart, and one vocabulary is the only thing

   stand as ai4 last drew it. So on first paint the module head was still four
   separate sections with a hairline between each: no wash, no single closing
   rule, the level card without its foot, and no `data-view` for the stylesheet
   to address. Any interaction at all called `render` again, by then the fully
   wrapped one, and the band appeared — which is why it read as the layout
   correcting itself a moment after load rather than as a missing pass.
