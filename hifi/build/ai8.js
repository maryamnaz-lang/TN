   TAL'S SCOPE — WHAT THE CANDIDATE'S ASSISTANT ANSWERS, AND WHAT IT HANDS ON

   Every earlier `ai*.js` pass added a CAPABILITY: ai.js searches the
   interview transcripts, ai2.js writes drafts and shows its own memory,
   ai3.js plays the other person in a roleplay, ai7.js books an interview.
   This file adds no capability. It draws the EDGE — the line between what
   Tal answers and what a person has to answer — and it makes the far side of
   that line a real reply rather than a shrug.

   THE SIX THINGS TAL IS FOR. A candidate asks about one of six subjects, and
   this is the whole of it:

     1. The course      the 13 chapters, what is in one, the two hours a week,
                        where you are behind, what the assessment measured.
     2. Your level      the Explorer track, what E3 means, what moves you up,
                        the re-interview at day 91, what is on your report.
     3. Your interviews booking one, preparing for one, practising against the
                        scenarios from one, and searching the transcript of
                        one you have already done.
     4. Your cohort     the Thursday call, the board, who leads it, where you
                        sit against the other nine.
     5. The money       what a fee is for, what the course fee covers, the two
                        refund windows, where the receipts are. Tal states the
                        POLICY and never the LEDGER — see `wLedger`.
     6. Tal itself      what it holds about you, where each line came from,
                        and how to correct it or switch it off.

   THE THREE THINGS IT DOES NOT DO, each with its own kind of answer, because
   "I cannot help" is three different sentences:

     a. A HUMAN DECISION — a refund, a disputed charge, a closed account, a
        level appeal, a date that has to move. Tal states the rule that
        applies and then hands over, because the rule is knowable and the
        decision is not. `wSupport` is that handover.
     b. SOMETHING IT CANNOT SEE — the billing ledger, the one-to-one thread
        with Priya, anything said on a cohort call. This is not modesty: it
        is the `NEVER` list on What Tal knows (ai2.js) and clause 4 of the
        Data use notice, and an answer that contradicts either of those is
        the worst kind of wrong answer, because the product says so on two
        other screens.
     c. NOT THE PRODUCT AT ALL — a salary, a job, an opinion about your boss,
        the answers to an assessment. One honest sentence and the way back.
        No support number: offering a helpdesk for "tell me a joke" is the
        same failure as inventing an answer, one politeness further on.

   AND THE RULE THAT MADE THIS FILE NECESSARY: TAL NEVER GUESSES. Before this
   pass, 50 of 111 plausible candidate questions fell through the router to
   "I can help with your course, your level, the cohort call and your points"
   — including four chips the product itself was printing — and a dozen more
   matched a broad route and came back CONFIDENTLY WRONG, which is worse.
   "Who leads this cohort?" answered with Thursday's agenda. "What does the
   rank number mean?" answered with Priya's note on how cautiously you talk.
   "Can I stop you reading my notes?" offered to write a reflection. Those
   are not gaps, they are a product asserting things about itself that are
   not true, and every one of them is fixed here by a narrower route landing
   in front of the broad one.

   HOW THE ORDER WORKS, AND WHY THIS FILE IS LAST. `talReply` (views.js) walks
   `TAL_ROUTES` and the FIRST match wins. Every pass `unshift`s, so the file
   parsed last is tried first — which is exactly what a correction needs. The
   broad routes in data.js are not edited: they stay as the general case and
   this file states the specific ones in front of them. Nothing here competes
   with ai7's `BK_ASK`: booking is checked immediately after this block, and
   every regex below that mentions an agent requires a comparison or a price
   word, never a bare "which agent".

   A ROUTE MAY DECLINE. `talReply` is wrapped at the foot of this file so that
   a route returning `''` — or throwing — lands on `talNoAnswer` rather than
   on the next route or on a blank bubble. So `return ''` means "I am the
   right route and I have nothing", which is a different statement from "I am
   not the right route", and only the first is expressible.

   THE QUESTION ITSELF, WHICH A ROUTE IS NOT GIVEN

   `talReply` is `for(const [m,fn] of TAL_ROUTES) if(m.test(q)) return fn()` —
   and that call takes NO ARGUMENT. Every route in every earlier pass is a
   closure over `S` and reads nothing from the question beyond the fact that
   it matched, so nobody had noticed: the regex is the whole of the parsing.

   Three routes here need the words. "What do chapters 4 and 12 cover?" has to
   read 4 and 12 out of the sentence, "compare Priya and Owen" has to know
   which two, and a broken-thing report has to tell a missing verification
   email from a video that will not play. Written as `(q) => q.match(...)`
   they threw on `undefined`, which the wrapper at the foot of this file
   swallowed into a support card — the failure mode this file exists to
   remove, arriving through the mechanism meant to prevent it.

   `TAL_Q` is set by that same wrapper, one statement before the router runs,
   so it is the question currently being answered. That is a smaller change
   than widening `talReply`'s call signature, and it does not ask the other
   six pass files to care.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
let TAL_Q = '';

/* THE HANDOVER, AND IT NAMES WHAT TO SAY. A support card that gives an
   address and stops has moved the work rather than done it: the candidate
   still has to work out what their question even is. So `wSupport` takes the
   thing to ask for, prints it as the first line, and the address underneath.

   It is a `.tw`, not a `.gen`. `.gen` is the generated-answer shell — it
   carries `talLabel()` and a source line, and it says "I worked this out from
   something". This is the opposite of that: it is the one card on which Tal
   is not the author. It also bleeds to the column edge on `--pad-x`, which is

   above the cap height so it pulls the eye before the words do. "Ask for" is
   a label like "Email" and "Phone" are labels: what you want, then where to

   candidate's behalf, on the first screen, and until now it had no route and
   landed on a capability list. The one question Tal has to answer perfectly
   is the one about itself.

   FIVE ROWS AND A SIXTH LINE THAT IS THE POINT. The rows are what it does;
   the closing line is what it does not, and it is there because an assistant
   that lists only its powers is the reason people stop trusting the answers.
   Naming the edge in the same breath is what makes the five credible.

   THE LAST ROUTE, WHICH MATCHES EVERYTHING

   Three fallbacks existed and all three were placeholders: `talReply`'s own
   "I can help with your course, your level, the cohort call and your points",
   `talPump`'s "I did not follow that one", and `askSend`'s. The first is a
   capability list pretending to be an answer.

   `talReply` is `for … if(m.test(q)) return fn()`, so a route at the END of
   the array that matches any string means the loop always returns and the
   internal fallback becomes unreachable. That is a smaller and more honest
   change than editing views.js: the sentence stays where it was written, it
   simply stops being the thing a person reads.

   PUSHED, NOT UNSHIFTED — the only route in this file that is, and getting it
   the wrong way round would make Tal answer every question with the support
   desk. */

/* AND THE WRAPPER, FOR THE TWO THINGS A ROUTE TABLE CANNOT DO.

   It captures the question — see the note over `TAL_Q`; the router does not
   pass it, and three routes here need the words rather than just the match.

   And it catches a throw. Every pass in this family wraps its render in a
   try/catch that warns, on the argument that a broken pass should be a
   console warning rather than a blank screen; the same argument applies to a
   broken answer, and more sharply, because the person is waiting for it. A
   route that throws now produces the support card and a warning, which is
   exactly what it would produce if it had honestly declined.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A WIDGET THAT OPENS THE BUBBLE DOES NOT NEED A GAP ABOVE IT

   §39.1 gives `.tw` a 16px top margin, which is what separates it from the
   sentence above it. Most of Tal's answers are a sentence and then a widget,
   so most of the time that is right. Some are the widget alone — `wNext`,
   `wRefund`, `wLeader` — and there the margin lands on top of the bubble's
   own 17px padding: 34px above the label, against 17px at the sides.

   CSS CANNOT TELL THE TWO APART. A bubble is built by assigning a string to
   `innerHTML`, so leading prose is a TEXT NODE — and `:first-child` counts
   elements only. The widget is `:first-child` whether or not a sentence sits
   above it, which makes the one selector that would answer this unable to.

   So it is answered here, where the string still exists. The test is a
   prefix, not a parse: does the reply BEGIN with a widget. One replacement,
   anchored, on the first occurrence only — and because every reply in the
   product passes through this wrapper it covers data.js's and ai2's answers
   as well as this file's, which a per-widget marker never would.

   THE CHIPS THAT WERE ASKING FOR THE ONE ANSWER TAL MAY NOT GIVE

   Every other dead chip in `TALCTX` is answered by a route above. These two

   have I paid so far?" and "Can I get a receipt?", and both ask Tal to read a
   ledger that two other screens say it has never seen. A chip is a promise
   the product makes on Tal's behalf, so the fix is at the chip and not only
