   EVERY PAGE OPENS WITH TAL SAYING WHAT THIS PAGE IS

   Until now Tal's card at the head of a page was ADVICE — "Before your
   re-interview", "What the 90 days ask of you" — and only nine of the
   twenty-three pages had one. That is a different job from the one this
   pass installs. The card is now a PAGE SUMMARY: two conversational
   sentences that tell you, before you read anything else, what is on this
   page and what is going on. Every page gets one, and they all read in the
   same voice.

   THREE THINGS CHANGE, AND ONLY IN THE HEAD BAND.

   1. The heading goes. "Tal" over a bold title over a grey sentence was
      three levels of hierarchy for one short paragraph, and the title was
      usually the page's own name said a second time. What is left is the
      mark, Tal's name, and the sentence — and with nothing above it to
      compete, the sentence is the prominent thing on the block, which is
      what it should have been all along. §33 gives it the ink to match.

   2. The suggested questions go, everywhere they appear at the top of a
      page. They were an offer made before you had read the page they were
      offering to explain, and on a summary they are noise around the one
      line you are meant to read. Tal is still one press away on the FAB,
      and the questions Tal's own panel offers are untouched — this pass
      only clears the top of a page.

   3. The card stops being a button. Its only visible affordance WAS the
      chips; with those gone, `enhanceTalCards`'s whole-card `role="button"`
      is an invisible control wrapped around a paragraph, which is worse
      than no control. Stripped here rather than in views.js because the
      chips are what justified it, and the chips leave here.

   A PASS, NOT TWENTY-THREE EDITS. The summaries are one voice and belong in
   one table; a page that gains a Tal card, or a whole new page, needs no
   work beyond a row in `PAGESUM`. This also reaches the four pages that
   have no `.ph` at all — report, agent, booking, messages — which
   `placeBand` skips by design, and gives them a band of their own with
   nothing in it but Tal.

   LAST IN THE JS ORDER, and that is load-bearing twice over: `placeBand`
   (ai5) has to have assembled the band before this can find it, and
   `enhanceTalCards` (views.js) has to have added its chips before this can
   take them out again.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE SUMMARIES

   SHORT. CONVERSATIONAL. THE FEW THINGS THAT MATTER. This table has been
   rewritten three times and every earlier version failed in a way worth
   recording, because the pull is towards all of them.

   The first version NAMED THE SECTIONS: "Points, badges and rank, and what
   moves each one." That is a caption, and a caption under a page the reader
   can already see is furniture. The test that kills it: could the line have
   been written without reading the page?

   The second version over-corrected into PROSE. It had the right facts and
   the wrong register — "The 90 days, closed out and gathered here",
   "This is the page that holds the evidence of what you did". Openers that
   set a scene, closers that explain what the page is for, five sentences
   where two would do. Nobody reads a summary for the writing. The client's
   word for it was "a story", and it is: a paragraph performing rather than
   telling you the two things you needed.

   The third version — the one this replaces — got the register right and
   still lost, on two counts that only show up once you look at the page
   rather than at the table.

   IT SAID WHAT THE GREY LINE ABOVE IT HAD JUST SAID. `ph()`'s second
   argument is a page description, and on nineteen pages it was a SENTENCE
   explaining the page — so the reader met the same fact twice, six
   millimetres apart, in two voices. Profile: "Your details, your
   preferences, and what Tal is allowed to do", then Tal saying "Your
   details, how you want to be contacted, and what Tal is allowed to do."
   Cohort: "Ten people at Explorer – E3, led by Priya Nair · week 5 of 13",
   then Tal saying "Ten of you at E3 with Priya leading, week 5 of 13". On
   Interviews the plate below it made it three times. That is fixed on BOTH
   sides and the split is now a rule: THE DESCRIPTION CARRIES FACTS, TAL
   CARRIES THE READING. Where a page has a factual spine it goes in the
   description as a `·` row — the shape Course Progress and one-candidate
   already used — and where it has none the description is dropped and the
   title stands alone over Tal's sentence. Before adding a summary here,
   read the page's `ph()` and make sure they are not the same sentence.

   IT EXPLAINED THE PRODUCT INSTEAD OF READING THE PAGE. A third of the
   table was policy and mechanism — "each row downloads its receipt",
   "closing your account is at the foot", "this is the only thing that sets
   or changes your level", "the same thread its members read on their own
   Cohort page". None of it is what a person came to catch up on, two of
   them pointed at controls the reader can see, and the last one explains
   the OTHER PORTAL to a leader who does not use it. An AI-native product
   does not get to spend its one paragraph describing itself.

   So the rule, and it is now five things:

     - TWO SENTENCES, 18 TO 28 WORDS. Not three. Say the thing and stop.
     - THE FACTS, IN THE ORDER A PERSON WOULD ASK FOR THEM. Where you are,
       what is open, what is on you. Numbers are the content: "day 34 of 90,
       5 of 13 chapters at 88%" is the whole first sentence.
     - IT MUST BE A CATCH-UP, NOT A DESCRIPTION. The reader is someone
       returning to a page they have seen before and wanting to know what
       moved. If the sentence would read the same next week, it is a caption.
     - NO FRAMING, NO POLICY, NO POINTING AT THE UI. Nothing that describes
       the page rather than what is on it, nothing about how the product
       works in general, and nothing about where a control is. The reader is
       looking at the page.
     - AND NOTHING FROM THE OTHER PORTAL. A candidate is not told they could
       lead a cohort; a leader is not told what their candidates' Cohort page
       looks like. Both were in the last version, twice each, and both are
       the reason a reader stops trusting the paragraph.
     - CONTRACTIONS, PLAIN WORDS. It is Tal talking to one person, not a
       report being filed.
     - Never repeat the page title or its description. Both are directly above.

   A value is a string, a function of the stage's config, or an object keyed
   by stage with `_` as the fallback. Functions get `f` — `cfg(S.stage)` —
   and read the same globals the views do, so the figures cannot drift from
   the page they are summarising.

   reads as somebody telling you. Twelve is the ceiling: past it the numeral
   IS how a person says the number, and a spelt "twenty-eight" beside a

   drop them and lose the one screen that greets you by time of day, it is
   derived. Four lines, one place.

   the one the reader will not notice. `getHours` is local time, which is the
   reader's, which is the only one a greeting can mean.

  /* THE GREETING HAS LEFT THE SUMMARY, AND IT IS THE PAGE'S `<h1>` AGAIN.
     Every entry in this block used to open with `<span class="tal-greet">
     Welcome back, Maryam!</span>`, which §33.9 sizes at 22px and — the other
     half of that decision — hides the page's own `.ph` for. It was the right
     shape while Tal's card was the first thing in the band: one voice, saying
     hello and then saying where you stand.

     §56 gives the band two columns and puts the title, the fact row and the
     steps ABOVE Tal in the left one, so the greeting would have been the
     fourth thing on the page and the second heading in the same column. The
     `.ph` is the heading again — `Welcome back, Maryam` over `Explorer Track
     – E3 · Cohort 41 · week 5 of 13`, which is exactly the pair the leader's
     dashboard has always drawn (`lead.js`, `ph('Welcome back, Priya', …)`) and
     the shape the frame asks for.

     NOTHING IS LOST FROM THE COPY: every `.ph` on the eight dashboard stages
     already carried the same words, because the greeting was written from
     them. What Tal says now starts at the reading, which is what the rest of
     the table has always done — and it means the summary is the only prose in
     the band on the dashboard too, not just on the other nineteen pages.

     `.tal-greet` ITSELF STAYS, in §33.9 and in the design system. It is a real
     component — a greeting line inside a summary — and `tn-agent-portal.html`
     is built on it. This is the candidate portal choosing the other shape, not
     the shape being withdrawn. */
  dashboard: {
    consult: 'Your quiz put you on the Explorer track from a score of 64. Jordan Blake calls on Thursday at 2:00 PM ET for fifteen minutes &mdash; nothing to prepare, and it doesn&rsquo;t set your level.',

    /* THE ONE ENTRY THAT OPENS ON A GREETING AGAIN, AND THE ONE THAT RUNS LONG.
       578:5966 makes Tal's sentence the whole left column of the band — there is
       no `<h1>` on screen above it (§70 hides the `.ph` for that band; the view's
       own note is the argument) — so the summary has to say hello, and it has
       the room to say more than the table's usual two sentences. Both are
       deliberate exceptions to the rules at the head of this file and both are
       local to this key: the other nine entries keep their 18–28 words under a
       title that is still drawn.

       IT IS NOT `.tal-greet`. That span is the mechanism §33.9 built for exactly
       this shape and it comes with `display:none` on the `.ph` and a 22px line;
       the file draws the greeting at the paragraph's own size and the heading is
       wanted in the accessibility tree. Plain text, so it types with the rest of
       the line rather than being filled in before the clock starts (`SUM_LEAVE`).

       THE THREE HIGHLIGHTS ARE `<b>`, WHICH IS WHAT `.ai-body p b` ALREADY IS.
       The file draws them as absolutely-placed tinted rectangles behind orange
       text; in markup that is one element with a ground, and §70 gives it the
       5%-accent wash and 4px radius the file measures. `sumRuns` walks text
       nodes, so the typing reveals them in place and the ghost holds the same
       box — inline markup here costs nothing.

       "ON THE RIGHT" BECAME "BELOW", AND THAT IS THE ONE COPY EDIT. 581:6671
       points at Priya as being in the right-hand column, which is where the file
       has her; the journey has that column here and the recommendation is the
       section under the band. A sentence that points at the wrong side of the
       screen is worse than one that points at no side. */
    /* 581:6671 VERBATIM, WITH TWO EDITS AND BOTH ARE WRITTEN DOWN. The file
       reads "Considering your strenghts" — a typo — and it points at Priya as
       being "on the right", which she is not on either surface: the file draws
       the recommendation in a section UNDER the band, the same as this page
       does, so the phrase is a leftover from a layout neither of us has. A
       sentence that points at the wrong side of the screen is worse than one
       that points at no side. Everything else is the file's words in the
       file's order, including "E1 - E5" as a range and "analyzed". */
    /* A FUNCTION, BECAUSE THE NAME IN IT IS NOW STATE. "Ask Tal for a different
       agent" swaps the card below for another of the three, and a summary that
       kept saying "Priya Nair" would be Tal naming a match the page is no
       longer showing — the exact drift the note at the head of this table is
       written to prevent. `recKey` and `AGENTS` are views.js's, parsed long
       before this file. It re-types when it changes, which is correct: Tal has
       said something new. */

    /* THE SAME SHAPE AS `new`, ONE STEP ON — greeting, then three phrases that

       journey column) and the three `data-sum` keys. `track` is the SECOND page
       to use that card, which is the whole point of keying by subject.

       AND IT IS DEAD COPY, KEPT IN SYNC ON PURPOSE. `ai7.js` overrides this key
       outright (`PAGESUM.dashboard.booked = () => …`) so that the name, the

       THE THREE ENROLLED STAGES — Figma 599:7418, and the same three
       exceptions §70 bought for `new`.

       599:7418 gives the course dashboards the AI-native head, so all three
       of the local rules `new`'s entry records apply here too and for the
       same reasons: the summary OPENS ON A GREETING (§71 hides the `.ph`, so
       there is no `<h1>` on screen above it), it RUNS LONGER than the
       table's usual 18–28 words (it is the band's whole left column rather
       than a paragraph beside a black card), and it CARRIES `<b>` PHRASES,
       which §70.2 grounds and §63 §10 inks.

       THE GREETING IS DERIVED — see `_greet` above. 599:7427 says "Good
       morning, Maryam!" and the other three dashboards say "Welcome Back";
       the file's is the better line and it is the one that can be false, so
       it is read off the clock rather than typed. Nothing else in the build
       knows the time of day, which is the argument for keeping it to four
       lines in one place.

       WHAT CAME OFF ALL THREE IS THE DAY. Every one of these opened on "Day
       N of 90" and that is now the second column's own figure, two inches to
       the right, in 32px type. Restating it is the duplication this table's
       note is mostly written to prevent — and it is what freed the words the
       longer shape needed.

       THE FILE'S SECOND PARAGRAPH IS A `<br>`, NOT A SECOND `<p>`.
       599:7434 draws two blocks with the paragraph spacing set to 0, so what
       it is asking for is a line break inside one paragraph — which is also
       the only shape `typeSummary` can take: `placeSummaryPass` assigns
       `'<p>' + text + '</p>'`, and a `<p>` inside a `<p>` is closed by the
       parser before it is opened. `sumRuns` walks TEXT nodes, so the break
       costs the typer nothing and the ghost holds the same box.
       ------------------------------------------------------------------ */
    /* WEEK 1 IS THE FILE'S OWN COPY WITH THE PRODUCT'S FIGURES IN IT, and it
       is the one entry where the two agree almost word for word: 599:7434

       45 minutes" and a "55-minute time on course target", and `CH[0]` is

       list or from the chart's own target line.

       course apart — which agent sets my level, which agent decides whether it
       moves — and `talRec` is the same block on both, so the sentence above it
       takes the same shape: what the record says, then the roster, then the

       IT STOPPED SHORT OF THE PLATE BEFORE, and the note here said so: "Book

       is gone (see `V.dashboard`'s day-90 branch), and what replaced it names
       an agent rather than explaining a decision — so the ban this was
       observing no longer applies and the guidance is the sentence's job again.

  /* AND THE PRE-INTERVIEW ONE IS THE DASHBOARD'S SENTENCE, SHORTENED (Maryam,
     31 Aug 2026). §70's `dashboard.new` narrates the same fact at length —
     "Based on your quiz results, you are currently on Explorer track. Your
     level from E1 - E5 anchors after a 45-minute interview" — and this page
     said it flatly, in Tal's earlier voice, with no accent phrase in it. Two
     summaries of one fact in two registers is the thing this table is mostly
     written to stop, so this one is the dashboard's, cut to the part My Level
     is about.

     WHAT IT DROPS is the whole of the dashboard's second half: the roster, the
     match and Priya. That is a recommendation, and the page it belongs to is
     the one that draws her card underneath it — here the block directly below
     is the ladder, and the note two sections down already carries "an interview
     with an agent sets the level" with the button that books one.

     THREE ACCENT PHRASES, WHICH IS THE DASHBOARD'S COUNT. §70.2's highlight is
     `.modhead .ai-aura.talsum .ai-body p b` and is not scoped to the AI-native
     band, so a `<b>` here gets the same tinted ground; §63 §10 owns the ink.
     They are the three things the sentence is actually about — what you did,
     where it put you, and what decides the rest — and every figure in it is the
     ladder's own (`trackBand` marks exactly those five rungs). */
  /* REWRITTEN TO MARYAM'S COPY, 2 Sep 2026, and three things about it are
     stated rather than quietly adjusted, because each is a rule this table's
     own head sets and this line is now the exception to it.

     IT IS 36 WORDS AGAINST THE STATED 28 CEILING, and it is two full sentences
     rather than a sentence and a clause. The ceiling is the reason `result`'s
     entry names only the lowest band of the two ("28 is the ceiling — see the
     head of this block"), so this is the first entry over it.

     THE SECOND SENTENCE NAMES THE LADDER, which is the fourth of this table's
     four content bans — no pointing at the UI. It reads as a pointer at the
     block 80px below rather than as a fact about the candidate; the mitigation
     is that the three track NAMES and the five-per-track count are facts the
     sentence states, not instructions to look at something.

     THE ARROWS FALL OUT OF SÖHNE AND ARE SET BY THE STAND-IN. §11's stack is
     Söhne then 'Grotesk Stand-in' and nothing else — Inter was removed for
     exactly this, "every character Söhne's trial file does not carry was
     silently set in a different typeface" — and §64's note records that the
     trial file carries 68 glyphs and an arrow is not one of them (which is why
     the quiet button's arrow is a mask-image). So the two `&rarr;` here are the
     first rendered arrow characters in the product and they change face
     mid-sentence. `&middot;` is in the face and is what every fact row in the
     build already uses; swapping the two characters is the whole fix if the
     break shows.

     THE THREE `<b>` PHRASES ARE THE SAME THREE WORDS as before — quiz result,
     Explorer track, 45-minute interview — so §70.2's tinted ground still lands
     on what you did, where it put you and what decides the rest. */

       ARE READ OFF THE CARD RATHER THAN TYPED. The name, the expertise and the
       level range are all printed 80px below in `.crow-x` ("Expertise: System
       Architecture, assesses E1&ndash;E3"), and that row is built from
       `CALL_ROW.iv()` — so this reads the same call and the two cannot
       disagree on one screen. The line it replaces hard-coded "Priya Nair",
       which `bkStamp` does not reach on this view (it rewrites the plate, the
       Scheduled tile and `PAGESUM.dashboard.booked`, not this table), so
       booking Owen left the summary naming Priya.

       `x` IS SPLIT RATHER THAN RE-DERIVED, deliberately. Re-deriving means
       copying `CALL_ROW.iv`'s four-step precedence line — the one its own note
       spends fifteen lines on, because a `typeof` guard on a `const` in the
       temporal dead zone THREW and took a whole first paint with it. Splitting
       the string the card already renders keeps one source and one precedence;
       if that format ever changes, both surfaces move together or break
       together, which is the failure worth having.

       "SHE'LL" IS THE ONE WORD THAT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE DERIVED NAME. Book
       Owen or Samuel and the pronoun is wrong while the three facts are right —
       one word against the four it replaces. Left as Maryam wrote it because
       Priya is who the prototype books by default and she is who the demo
       walks; "They'll" is the fix if a second agent is ever demoed.

       TWO ACCENT PHRASES, THE ACTIONABLE PAIR: the appointment, and the fact
       that it can be joined now. The assessment detail and the consequence are
       what the sentence explains, not what it asks you to do.

       their prices and their slots, on the reasoning that "a summary of a
       directory is the directory read aloud"; this line names the count, the

  /* NO `agent` AND NO `booking` ENTRY, AND BOTH ARE DELETIONS RATHER THAN
     REWRITES (Maryam, 31 Aug 2026). The two pages either side of paying are
     the ones where Tal had least left to say, and on both of them the
     sentence was a read-back of the block directly under it:

     `agent` was "<name> assesses E2–B1 and has run 164 interviews, rated 4.6
     out of 5. $85 for 45 minutes, next free Friday 21 August at 5:00 PM." —
     six figures, and the `.agid` block, the three `.kv` rows and the slot
     picker four inches below state every one of them. It also carried the one
     disagreement on the page: `a.slot` is the agent's own next free time and
     the picker is hard-coded to Thursday 20 at 6:30, so for four of the five
     agents Tal named a slot the page was not offering.

     `booking` was "Nothing to prepare and nothing to bring — Thursday is a
     conversation, not a test." The `.note succ` banner is the first thing
     under the title and the page is a receipt; a second voice above a
     confirmation reads as a caveat on it.

     THIS IS NOT THE "A PAGE WITH NO ENTRY IS WORSE THAN WRONG" TRAP (trap 11
     in CLAUDE.md). That one is about a view that HAND-AUTHORS an `.ai-aura`
     card: `placeSummaryPass` strips the card's action and chips before it
     reaches `if(!text) return`, so the card survives stripped and unstyled.
     Neither of these views draws a card — both had theirs removed when this
     file was written — so the pass builds nothing, `placePageSummary` calls
     `sumIdle()` to clear the typing key, and `placeBand` returns at its own
     `if(!aura)`. The band is the title and, on `agent`, the slot plate.

     `_slot` still has readers, so it stays. The `booking` override in ai7 is
     gone with this one — see the note where it was. */

  /* THE COURSE'S SHAPE MOVED TO THE PAGE DESCRIPTION — "90 days · 13

     date the cohort opens, and "one payment, and the re-interview is
     included" is printed on it in full. Tal saying any of that again is the
     duplication this file's own note is mostly written to prevent.

     states and the question somebody actually hesitates over. The second

     sections down. And "each row downloads its receipt" is a caption for a
     button. A total and a count is what a person opens Payments for; the
     rows are the itemisation. Counted from the same conditions `V.billing`
     pushes them on, so the two cannot disagree. */
  /* `billing` IS BACK (Maryam, 31 Aug 2026, later the same day: show Tal's
     summary on this page) AND IT SAYS SOMETHING THE DELETED ONE COULD NOT.

     THE DELETED ONE WAS A COUNT AND A TOTAL, and both reasons it went still
     stand: the table under it is those rows, each with its date, its card and
     its amount, so "one payment, $490" was the table read aloud — and the half
     that was not in the table was the policy clause "nothing here renews",
     which is the second of this table's four content bans. Restoring that
     sentence is not what was asked for and would fail twice over.

     AND THERE IS A HARDER RULE THAN EITHER: TAL HAS NEVER SEEN THIS PAGE. The
     `NEVER` list on What Tal knows (ai2.js) ends on "Your card details and
     billing history", clause 4 of the Data use notice says the same, and
     `wLedger` (ai8) DECLINES "What have I paid so far?" and points here rather
     than answering it. So a summary that names a figure off this table — the
     count, the total, the card, any of it — makes three other surfaces into
     lies, and it is the one kind of wrong answer ai8's own note calls the
     worst: "the product says so on two other screens".

     SO THE SUMMARY IS TAL SAYING WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, which is not a hedge and
     not an apology — it is subject 6 of Tal's six (Tal itself: what it holds
     about you and what it does not), and on the one page whose whole subject is
     outside its reach it is the most useful true thing available. It is also
     not the "no policy" ban: that ban is on product-behaviour filler
     ("nothing renews"), and this is a statement about Tal's own access.

     THE SECOND SENTENCE IS A PROMISE THE PRODUCT KEEPS. `wRefund` (ai8) reads
     the two refund windows off the legal lines on `V.booking` and `V.payment`
     and states the rule before handing to a person, which is answer-kind (a) in
     ai8's table — so "ask about the refund windows" routes to a real answer.
     It is also the ask dock's own placeholder on this view, so the line and the
     field under it are offering the same thing.

     THE VIEW DRAWS NO TAL CARD, so this is an entry and nothing else — trap 11
     only bites where a card is hand-authored (see `agents` above). */
  /* REPLACED WITH MARYAM'S COPY, 2 Sep 2026 — AND IT REVERSES THE RULE THE
     THREE PARAGRAPHS ABOVE ARGUE FOR. Tal now reads the ledger out loud: the
     charge, its amount, the three saved cards and which one is default. The
     argument above is kept in full rather than deleted, because it is the
     record of what this line used to be for and of the three surfaces it was
     keeping honest.

     THREE SURFACES NOW DISAGREE WITH IT, and all three are one edit each:

       1. `NEVER[2]` (ai2.js) — "Your card details and billing history." That
          array is clause 4 of the Data use notice on `V.account`, rendered as
          an eye-off row, so the product tells the reader on that page that Tal
          cannot see exactly what it has just recited here.
       2. `wLedger` (ai8.js) — the route for "What have I paid so far?"
          DECLINES and links this page. Ask Tal the question this summary now
          answers and Tal says it cannot answer it.
       3. The ask dock's placeholder on this view is "Is my card stored?",
          which was written to pair with the old line's offer.

     ai8's own note calls this the worst kind of wrong answer — "the product
     says so on two other screens" — so if the new reading is the one to keep,
     those three go with it. Left alone deliberately: changing Tal's stated
     access to billing is a product decision, not a copy edit, and it is not
     what was asked for.

     THREE ACCENT PHRASES, THE ACTIONABLE ONES (Maryam, 2 Sep 2026): the
     amount, what it bought, and the card that will be charged next. The two
     non-default cards stay in ink — they are context for the default, and
     lighting all three would put the wash on most of the sentence.

     EVERY FIGURE IN IT IS PRINTED BELOW — $490, Explorer Track &ndash; E2, the
     three card rows and the Default chip are the table and the card list this
     summary sits on top of. That is the `agents` objection ("a summary of a
     directory is the directory read aloud") on a third page; noted, not acted
     on. Worth knowing if it is ever revisited: the ONE fact on this page no
     row states is that the E2 charge went to the Mastercard, not to the
     default Visa. */

   AND IT TYPES ITSELF

   The summary is the one line on the page that is WRITTEN RATHER THAN
   STORED — it is Tal's reading of where you are, assembled from `S` at the
   moment you arrive. Printed whole it looks like a caption that was always
   there; typed, it reads as something being said to you now, which is what
   it is. That is the whole of the argument, and it is why this animates the
   summary and nothing else at the head of a page.

   THE HEIGHT IS RESERVED BEFORE THE FIRST CHARACTER. A typewriter that
   simply appends text grows its own box, and this box is at the top of the
   page with the whole page under it — two lines arriving one at a time
   would shove the page down 26px mid-read, and on the dashboard the
   `.stp-wing` beside it re-centres as it goes. So the paragraph is drawn
   TWICE: `.tsum-g` is the finished line, `visibility:hidden`, holding the
   final box open, and `.tsum-t` is the visible copy laid over it,
   absolutely positioned, filling in. §52 owns those two rules. Both are
   built from the same `innerHTML`, so they wrap identically and the typed
   text lands exactly where the finished text will be.

   THE GREETING DOES NOT TYPE, WHERE THERE IS ONE. `<span class="tal-greet">`
   is not part of the sentence — §33.9 sets it at 22px and hides the page's own
   `.ph` when it is present, so it IS the page's title, and no other page's
   `<h1>` types itself in. Its text nodes are filled before the clock starts;
   the sentence under it is what animates. The test is `closest()` rather than a
   node count, so a second block-level span in the same paragraph gets the
   same answer without an edit here.

   NO SUMMARY IN THIS BUILD CARRIES ONE ANY MORE — the note over `PAGESUM`'s
   `dashboard` block is where that is written down: §56's two-column band puts
   the title and the fact row above Tal, so the eight dashboards greet you from
   their `.ph` like every other page. `SUM_LEAVE` stays because the shape does:
   `dsTypeSummary` is the same twelve lines in the design system, and
   `tn-agent-portal.html` still opens its dashboard with a greeting.

   ONE RUN PER ARRIVAL, and `sumKey` is what decides what an arrival is —
   the portal, the view, the stage, AND THE TEXT. The first three are the
   page; the text is there because a detail page keeps its view name while
   its subject changes (`S.ldrMem`, `S.ldrCo`), and because a summary that
   has genuinely changed under you — a booking made, a stage advanced — is a
   new reading and reads better re-typed than silently swapped. A re-render
   that leaves the sentence alone does not re-type: it prints instantly,
   which is why every other interaction on the page is unaffected.

   AND IT SURVIVES A RE-RENDER MID-RUN. `render()` replaces
   `device.innerHTML`, so the nodes this is writing into are thrown away by
   any interaction — and at boot by the two passes after this one, each of
   which ends with its own `render()` (trap 8). Resuming from `_sumAt`
   rather than restarting is what stops those three synchronous boot renders
   from showing the line three times from zero; the generation counter is
   what stops the abandoned rAF loops from writing into detached nodes.

   `setTimeout` AND NOT `requestAnimationFrame`, WHICH IS THE ONE THING HERE
   THAT WAS FOUND RATHER THAN CHOSEN. rAF is the right scheduler for anything
   that has to agree with the compositor, and it is the wrong one for this:
   a hidden document does not get frames AT ALL, so the first version left
   the summary showing nothing but the greeting — indefinitely — in any tab
   that was not at the front when the page booted, which includes the preview
   pane this was verified in. `setTimeout` is throttled in the background
   rather than stopped, and because every tick derives what to show from the
   ELAPSED TIME rather than from a counter, a throttled tick simply arrives
   with more characters to reveal. Worst case in a background tab the line
   lands whole in one step, which is the correct answer for a page nobody is
   looking at. `SUM_STEP` at 16ms is a frame's worth, so on screen it is
   indistinguishable from the rAF version.

   `reduce()` (ai4) is the same helper the ask transitions use. Under it the
   line prints whole, immediately — a two-second reveal is exactly the kind
   of motion that setting is asking us not to make.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/* THE PACE, AND IT IS A BUDGET RATHER THAN A RATE. `SUM_MS` is what a whole
   line may take and the per-character interval is derived from it, so a
   28-word summary and an 18-word one both finish in about the same time —
   which is what makes the effect read as one consistent habit of Tal's
   rather than as a page-by-page delay.

   3400ms, AND IT GOT THERE IN TWO STEPS FROM 1500 — BY EYE, WHICH IS THE
   ONLY WAY TO SET THIS. The first version divided 1500ms across the line: at
   the ~150 characters these summaries run to that is 10ms each, and 10ms
   reads as the sentence APPEARING rather than as being written, which is the
   whole point of doing it at all. 2300 was better and still hurried. At 3400
   the interval lands near 22ms and the line reads as somebody typing it,
   which is what was asked for both times.

   THE NUMBER TO CHANGE IS THIS ONE, and the floor and the ceiling only guard
   the division. Measured across all 128 summaries the build actually draws:
   the longest is 192 characters and prices at 17.7ms, so `SUM_MS` alone sets
   the pace for the body of the table; the shortest is 63 (`transcript`) and
   would crawl at 54ms a character, so the 34ms ceiling catches it and it
   lands in 2.1s instead of 3.4. `SUM_MIN` is never reached today — it is
   there for a summary longer than about 240 characters, which the 18-28 word
   rule in `PAGESUM`'s own note is supposed to prevent. */

     anything we draw here is a second set of chrome around a screen that has

     have. It is the one pass that has to be told.

     Tested on the slot rather than on the two view names, for the reason the
     composer exclusion in ai4 gives: the condition is "this page is a frame we
     do not own", and a third view that embeds one would want the same answer
     without having to be added to a list. `PAGESUM.coursework` and

     summary. Tal's `messages` entry said Priya can see your chapters and that
     her last message asked for the vendor review example: the first half is a

     paraphrase of a bubble already on screen.

     It also cost the thread real height, on the one page in the product whose
     footer has to be reachable without scrolling (§37.7): the band took ~116px
     off a box that the composer sits at the bottom of.

     fit the frame with its composer at the foot, which is the height the band
     was taking. A separate class rather than reusing `.msg-page` because that
     class also carries the candidate page's own flex layout (§16, §37.7), and
     this page is a tab strip over two surfaces, not one thread. */

     one is for a page whose reason is its own content, and `V.leadSum` is the
     first (Maryam, 1 Sep 2026): the 90-day summary page IS a summary, so Tal's
     line was reprinting the recommendation the page states as a `.kv` row and
     the four figures it states as a `.stats` band.

     IT MUST BE CHECKED HERE, BEFORE STEP 1, and that is the whole reason this is
     a `return` at the top rather than a `PAGESUM` entry deleted. Trap 11: the
     stripping passes run FIRST — `talFirst` hoists, `placeBand` claims, and only
     then does this function look for text — so a page with no entry gets its
     card stripped of its action and its words and then left in a shape §33 does
     not style, which renders the head band ~700px wider than the page. An early
     return means no card is inserted at all.

     THE KEY IS STILL CLEARED, because `placePageSummary` is the two-line wrapper
     that exists for exactly this: only the success path returns `true`, so an
     opt-out cannot leave a stale typing key behind and make the NEXT page print
     instantly (the eight-plain-`return`s note above says why). */

     the other only when both exist. `.sec.ask-chips` is the row Points draws
     with no card around it. Scoped to the band — or, on a page that has no

     `askChip` was used two ways. Inside a Tal card it is Tal's own suggested
     next question and it belongs there — the card says who is asking. Dropped
     straight into page flow (`<div class="mt5">${askChip(…)}</div>` on the
     report, the clip list, the cohort card) it is a lone pill in the middle of
     a column of prose: nothing says it is Tal's, nothing says why it is there,
     and the ask bar at the foot of the frame is the standing answer to
     "anything else?" on every page in the product. Two invitations to ask,
     the floating one quieter and less explicable than the docked one.

     THE TEST IS "IS IT IN SOMETHING THAT IS TAL'S" — the aura card, the panel,
     the thread, a sheet, or the band this pass has just built. Anything else
     is page flow. The empty wrapper goes with it, because `.mt5` on a div with
     nothing left in it is 24px of space nobody can see the reason for.
     `.chip-tal` is also what the Tal panel's suggestions and the thread's
     follow-ups are made of, which is why the closest() list is the guard
     rather than a blanket removal. */

     That was right when the row held a heading for the button to sit beside;
     with the heading gone the button is the whole row, and §25's `act` area
     draws it as a full-width black bar between Tal's name and the sentence
     it is meant to be about. It reads as the summary, and it is the loudest
     thing in a band whose job is to be read first.

     Removed rather than restyled: every one of these steps is also on the

   A PHRASE IN THE SUMMARY OPENS A SECOND SUMMARY — Figma 596:7020 (596:7379)

   The three accent phrases in Tal's sentence were a ground and an ink; they are
   controls now. Press one and a card opens under it with the reading BEHIND
   that phrase — where the claim came from, what it means, and the one thing to
   do about it. That is the difference between a page that states a conclusion
   and one you can ask "why".

   THE KEYS ARE SUBJECTS, NOT POSITIONS, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS REUSABLE.
   `data-sum="quiz"` is written into the summary string itself, so any entry in
   `PAGESUM` — this dashboard's, another stage's, the leader's — can mark a
   phrase and get the same card with no new code. Three exist; a fourth is one
   row in `SUMDROP` and one attribute. Nothing here is keyed to `new`.

   EVERY FIGURE IS READ, NONE RESTATED. The quiz card counts its own bands out
   of `SCORES`, the match card reads `AGENTS` and `REC` for whoever `recKey()`
   currently names, and the track card is the file's copy verbatim. So swapping
   the agent changes the third card with the sentence above it, and a change to
   a score moves the first one.

   A VALUE IS A FUNCTION OR AN OBJECT, the same shape `PAGESUM` uses, with four
   parts: `lead` (what is true), `label` + `read` (what it means, the label in
   its own hue), `next` (what to do), and `act` (the way to do it).

   already wrong (see `track`).

   IT ALSO ANSWERS "THE PAGE I AM ALREADY ON". `V.interviews` is where a
   booking is listed, so offering "See the booking" from the Interviews page is
   a button that reloads the page under it — §60's dead control by another

     stage, which is what it exists to prevent.

     `S.booking` is only written when a reader actually walks ai7's flow in the
     thread. Arriving at `#booked` from the stage picker or a link leaves it
     null while every other surface on the page reads the appointment perfectly
     — `bkRec()` is `S.booking || S.bk || {defaults}`, which is why `bkLong()`

     it just now", and the question here is "is there an interview", which is
     `cfg(S.stage)`.

     AND `f.pred` ALONE IS NOT THAT QUESTION — the second half of the same bug.
     `CFG.booked` is `{pred:true, booked:true}`: `pred` means the LEVEL is only
     predicted, which stays true right up until an agent signs it, so it is

     SIX MORE, FOR THE FIVE SUMMARIES REWRITTEN ON 2 Sep 2026 (Maryam). The
     standing rule from that ask: a phrase is highlighted ONLY if pressing it
     says something — *"if you feel somewhere that there should not be any
     popover against a highlighted text then you can remove the highlight from
     that text so user does not expect anything"*. So the accent and the card
     are one decision, and every phrase those five lines light has a row here.

     THREE PHRASES REUSE EXISTING KEYS rather than getting near-duplicates:
     `quiz` and `track` for the two the dashboard already explains, and
     `interview` for the appointment on both booked pages. That is what the
     head of this block means by "the keys are subjects, not positions".

  /* WHAT A LEVEL INTERVIEW IS, BEFORE THERE IS ONE. Two phrases across two
     pages point here — "45-minute interview" on My Level and "45-minute
     conversation" on Interviews — because they are the same subject named
     twice, and one card is what stops the two pages explaining it differently.

     IT IS NOT `interview`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON IT EXISTS. That key
     opens "Your interview with Priya Nair is booked for…", which is false on
     every stage before one is. This card names no agent and no date, so it is
     true whether or not anything is booked, and its action is `_bookedAct`'s

/* --- the pass -------------------------------------------------------------
   IT RUNS AFTER `placePageSummary` AND IT MEASURES THE GHOST.
   `typeSummary` draws the paragraph twice — `.tsum-g` is the finished line held
   hidden to keep the box open, `.tsum-t` is the visible copy laid over it. The
   visible one is BUILT UP a character at a time, so mid-type its copy of the
   phrase is half a word wide or not there at all; the ghost is complete from
   the first frame. So the card is positioned against the ghost and clicked on
   the live copy, which is the one on top and the only one that can take a
   pointer (`visibility:hidden` does not).

   IT DOES NOT CALL `render()` — §65's lesson. `render()` replaces
   `device.innerHTML` and resets the scroller, and this pass is also what the
   click handler calls, so opening a card two thirds down a scrolled page would
   throw the reader back to the top. The card is added and removed on its own;
   `S.sumDrop` is what survives the next real render.

   THE POSITION IS INLINE STYLE AND THAT IS NOT TRAP 1. Trap 1 is about DESIGN
   declarations losing to inline styles no stylesheet can answer; these two are
   measured pixels that only exist at runtime, which is the one thing inline
   style is for. Everything about how the card LOOKS is in §70.8. */
