/* ============================================================
   ICONS — Material Symbols (Apache 2.0), the ROUNDED style at
   FILL 0, wght 400, GRAD 0 — Google's current icon library, and
   LINEAR: open forms with rounded terminals, not solid ones.

   This replaces the Material *Icons* filled cut the platform ran
   on until 31 Aug 2026 (Maryam, by name and with the Google
   Fonts panel: Material Symbols / Rounded / Fill off). Every
   mark below is the official Rounded outlined file from
   google/material-design-icons, pasted rather than drawn, so the
   whole platform is one optical family and there is nothing to
   keep in sync by hand.

   THE GRID CHANGED AND THAT IS THE ONE THING THAT BREAKS A CALL
   SITE. Material Icons were 24x24 with y down from 0. Material
   Symbols are `0 -960 960 960` — forty times the size, with the
   baseline at y=0 and the glyph drawn ABOVE it, into negative y.
   A Symbols path in a `0 0 24 24` box renders as an invisible
   speck in the top-left corner; nothing throws. The proxy at the
   foot of this file states the viewBox once, and the two dozen
   call sites that wrap `inner()` in an <svg> of their own were
   all repointed with it — grep `viewBox="0 0 24 24"` after
   touching this file and expect only the four exceptions below.

   WHAT IS STILL ON THE 24 GRID, all deliberately. The BUILT
   portal contains exactly five and every one is correct:
   `nil.js`'s `NILP` proxy and views.js's two `ls-*` chapter
   player marks — the NIL microsite and the LightspeedVT mock are
   pictures of somebody else's UI, which is why `build.py`
   excludes both from the design system too — plus the prototype
   chrome's Back and Reset buttons, which live in `build.py`'s
   HTML TEMPLATE rather than in a layer, because the frame around
   the device is not the product. In source, add `CHEV` and
   `TN_MARK` (the brand's own marks, which carry their own boxes)
   and `tn-agent-portal.html`'s own chrome Reset. That is the
   whole list; anything else is a call site that was missed.

   THE PREVIOUS NOTE'S ARGUMENT IS REVERSED, NOT LOST. The filled
   cut was chosen because the set had drifted half-filled and
   half-outlined, and two weights of one idea in a row read as a
   mistake. That reasoning still holds and is what makes this
   safe: the fix was never "fill everything", it was "pick one
   cut and hold it". The cut is now linear. So the three marks
   that used to be called out as deliberately open — `circle`,
   `circleDash`, `check` — need no exception any more.

   FOUR MARKS ARE STILL FILLED, AND THAT IS NOT A HOLE IN THE
   RULE — IT IS THE OTHER HALF OF IT. In Material Symbols `FILL`
   is an axis for conveying STATE, not a second look: a lit
   rating slot, a done tick, a solid stop. `star`/`starOutline`,
   `checkFilled` and `stopFilled` are the four, the full argument
   and the test for adding a fifth are written over them below,
   and the short version is: a mark earns FILL 1 only when the
   SAME glyph also appears unfilled and the difference is the
   information. `trophy`, `certificate` and `shield` do not
   qualify — they are subject marks, and they stay linear.

   `stars()` (views.js, and the agent portal's own copy) is where
   that pairing is spent, and it is the one call site that had to
   change: it printed one glyph five times and let colour carry
   the rating, which was doing half the work under a solid set
   and would have been doing all of it under this one.

/* ============================================================
   THE FILLED EXCEPTIONS — AND FILL IS A STATE, NOT A STYLE.

   The set is FILL 0. These are the marks that carry FILL 1, and
   the rule is Google's own rather than ours: in Material Symbols
   `FILL` is an AXIS FOR CONVEYING STATE — selected/unselected,
   on/off, done/not done — not a second look you may prefer. So
   the platform sits at 0 and flips to 1 to say "this one is on".

   Which makes the list short and testable. A mark gets FILL 1
   only where the fill IS the information, i.e. where the SAME
   glyph also appears unfilled somewhere and the difference is
   what a reader is being asked to see:

     star / starOutline    a rating's lit and unlit slots
     checkFilled           done, against `checkOutline`'s not-done
     stopFilled            a solid dot, which is what its name says

   Everything else stays linear even when it is about an
   achievement, because it never appears both ways: `trophy`,
   `certificate` and `shield` are SUBJECT marks — the topic of a
   Tal widget, a stat cell's category, the security note beside a
   card form — and a filled trophy would be an award nobody has
   or has not won. `circleDash` needs no entry either: Rounded's
   `radio_button_checked` already draws its centre solid at
   FILL 0, so "this one, now" is drawn by the glyph, not the axis.

   THIS IS WHY THE KEYS THAT SAY "FILLED" KEPT THEIR NAMES. Under
   a filled set `checkFilled` and `stopFilled` read as leftovers;
   under this one they are the axis, stated in the key, and
   `checkOutline` is the other end of the same pair.

/* VERIFIED IS ITS OWN GLYPH AND IT IS NOT `checkFilled` — Maryam, 31 Aug 2026,
   about the recommendation card's green mark ("use verified icon instead of
   tick mark here").

   THE TWO MARKS SAY DIFFERENT THINGS AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON. A ringed
   tick is "this is done" — it is what `jrnList` puts against a finished step
   and what `signedSummary` puts against a signed report. A scalloped badge is
   "this identity has been checked", which is a property of the person rather
   than a state of anything, and it is the mark every product that vets people
   uses for exactly this. Beside a name the ringed tick was reading as "Priya
   Nair: complete".

   Material Symbols Rounded, FILL 0, wght 400, 24px optical, pasted from
   `symbols/web/verified/materialsymbolsrounded/verified_24px.svg` rather than
   drawn — the rule this whole file is built on. It is on the `0 -960 960 960`
   grid like everything else here, so the proxy at the foot states its viewBox
   and no call site needs one.

   IT KEEPS `checkFilled`'S GREEN AND ITS 20px BOX. §70.5 states both on
   `.rec-v` and neither is about which glyph is inside; the ring and the badge
   have the same optical weight at 20, so nothing moves. */

/* THE STAR IS FILLED AND ITS UNLIT SLOT IS `starOutline`. A rating is the one
   place in the product where the same glyph is printed five times and only the
   fill says what the number is, so this is the axis doing exactly the job it
   exists for. `stars()` (views.js, and the agent portal's own copy) picks
   between the two; it used to print `star` five times and separate them with a
   `.f` class and COLOUR alone, which was doing half the work when the glyph was
   solid and would have been doing all of it here.

   `star` is filled at every OTHER call site too, and that is deliberate rather
   than incidental: all of them are ratings or standings — `.rec-r`'s agent
   score, the widget that explains that score, the pulse's "Your standing"
   column. There is no call site where an empty star would be right. */

/* HOURGLASS — `hourglass_top`, not `hourglass_empty`. Outlined, the empty cut
   is two hollow triangles and at the 15px a status mark is drawn at it reads

   time that has not run yet. That is the state it is used for: a step that is
   yours and is not finished. `circleDash` used to carry that meaning and could
   not — a ring with a dot in it is a radio button, which is a CONTROL, and

/* THE ONE MARK IN HERE THAT IS NOT GOOGLE'S. Every other path above is the
   official Rounded outlined file; this one is TRACED, off the 27px PNG Maryam
   supplied for the Tal button. Material's `chat` (line above) is a bubble with
   a tail and rules inside it, which at the 22px the FAB draws collapses into
   mush. Hers is a squircle with the bottom-left corner squared off instead of
   tailed, and TWO rules, a long one and a short one, far enough apart to
   survive at that size.

   IT IS THE SAME TRACE, MOVED ONTO THE NEW GRID — not re-drawn. The measured
   24-box path was mapped through (x,y) -> (40x, 40y - 960), the exact affine
   that takes Material Icons' box to Material Symbols'. A uniform scale plus a
   translate cannot change a shape, and it was checked the way the trace itself
   was: both versions rendered into one 960 box, bounding boxes equal to 2dp.
   Re-tracing it against the Rounded cut would have been a redrawing of a mark
   that is not Google's to begin with.

   `chat` above is untouched — the rail's messages icon still uses it. */

/* COHORT IS `communities`, AND EVERY PEOPLE GLYPH IN THE LIBRARY WAS TRIED
   FIRST (Maryam, 31 Aug 2026 — the rail's cohort and payment marks "should not
   look like half filled").

   THE FINDING IS THE USEFUL PART: **Material Symbols has no linear
   multi-person mark.** `groups`, `group`, `groups_2`, `groups_3`, `diversity_1`
   `diversity_2`, `diversity_3`, `group_add` and `supervised_user_circle` are
   all SOLID SILHOUETTES at FILL 0 — Google draws overlapping figures filled on
   purpose, because outlining two heads that overlap turns to mush at 20px. So
   FILL 0 is not a promise that a mark is light: a glyph can be solid by
   construction, and swapping `groups` for another people glyph changes nothing.
   At the 22px the rail draws, any of them is a dark blob among ten line
   drawings — which is exactly the "half filled" read.

   The way out is to stop drawing PEOPLE and draw the GROUP: `communities` is a
   bounded circle with its members inside it, entirely outline, and it is
   Google's own mark for this idea rather than a shape borrowed to stand in for
   it. `hub` and `workspaces` are the other two that survive at 22px and both
   lose the meaning — a network and three objects. `co_present` reads as
   presenting to a room, which is the leader's job, not the cohort.

   THE KEY IS STILL `group`, SO NOTHING MOVED. It is read by the rail, the
   leader's Cohorts module, `PH_IC`'s fact rows and three notifications; the

/* PAYMENTS IS `account_balance_wallet`, NOT `wallet`, for the same reason and
   with one extra constraint. `wallet` at FILL 0 is an outlined billfold with a
   SOLID clasp panel across its whole right third — the "half filled" read
   exactly. `account_balance_wallet` is the same subject drawn as a card with a
   coin slot: entirely outline, one small disc, legible at 22px.
   IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT `credit_card`, which is also linear and would have
   been the easy swap: `creditCard` is already a key here and is drawn on the
   payment rows and the card artwork, so the MODULE would have worn the same
   mark as the rows inside it. A wallet holds cards; that is the distinction
   the rail needs. `savings` and `price_check` were the other linear options
   and both change the subject — a piggy bank is not what Payments is. */

/* THE CALL'S SIX — `mic_off`, `videocam_off`, `present_to_all`, `front_hand`,
   `closed_caption`, `call_end` — the official Rounded outlined files, pasted,
   not drawn. `more_vert` is NOT here because `overflow` already is it.

   THE TWO "OFF" MARKS ARE THE SLASHED PAIR of the two live ones, which is why
   a muted microphone does not need a colour to read as muted — though §60
   gives it one anyway, because on a control bar the state has to carry from
   across a desk. Outlined, the slash reads BETTER than it did filled: it now
   cuts through an open form instead of across a solid one. */

/* THE FIFTH AND SIXTH FILLED MARKS, AND THEY PASS TRAP 7's TEST. The set sits
   at FILL 0 and flips to FILL 1 only to say "this one is ON" — `star`/
   `starOutline`, `checkFilled`/`checkOutline`, `stopFilled`. A vote is exactly
   that pair: the SAME glyph appears both ways and the difference is the thing
   the reader is being asked to see (you voted / you did not). `trophy`,
   `certificate` and `shield` fail the test and stay outlined because they are
   subject marks that never appear both ways.
   PASTED, NOT DRAWN, per the same trap — fetched from
   `google/material-design-icons` at
   `symbols/web/thumb_up/materialsymbolsrounded/thumb_up_fill1_24px.svg` (and
   `thumb_down`), which ship on the `0 -960 960 960` box these already use, so
   no regridding was needed and none was done. */

   official Rounded FILL 0 set per trap 7. `phone` is Material's `call` — the
   name is the product's word for what the control does, and `call` is already
   taken as a concept by `data-call` and `callOpen`, so a key called `call`
   here would read as the live-call surface rather than a glyph. `doneAll` is
   the double tick under a sent message: it is `done_all`, which exists in the

   FILL 0 IS NOT A PREFERENCE HERE, IT IS THE RULE. The four filled marks in

   `checkFilled` against `checkOutline` — and a bin has no unfilled twin in the

   ADDED 2 Sep 2026 for the saved-card row's Remove control, which is the first
   place the product deletes one of several things rather than the whole
   account. `V.account`'s "Delete my account" wears `misuse` — a circle-slash,
   which is the right mark for ending something that cannot be re-created and
   the wrong one for taking one card off a list of three. */

   polygons on a 194.28 canvas. NOT rebuilt on the 24 grid the

   the brand to fit a grid is how a logo drifts. The viewBox does
   the scaling, so `width`/`height` from the call site are all it
   needs, and it inherits `fill` like everything else here.

   It is the same three chevrons as `CHEV`, which is the section

   the product draws levels and headings with, and this is the
   logo's own lockup of three at the logo's own proportions.

   THE TAL CHAT'S ARROW IS A LINE, NOT A WEDGE

   Its own const rather than an `IP` entry, and that is forced
   rather than chosen: `IP` holds ONE FILLED PATH each and the
   proxy below wraps whatever it finds in a 24-box with no
   `fill` or `stroke` of its own. This mark is two STROKED
   paths on a 20-box — a shaft and a chevron — so there is no
   shape of it that the proxy can print.

   IT DOES NOT REPLACE `arrowRight`. Everything else in the
   product goes forward on the Material filled wedge, and the
   set is one optical family on purpose (the note at the head of
   this file, and CLAUDE.md's trap 7). This is the drawing Figma
   433:276 / 439:481 use in three places on ONE screen — the
   back control, the field's send, and the band — so it is an
   addition scoped to that screen, not a change to the set.

   `currentColor`, so the two places that draw it can each say
   what colour it is; and 1.5 rather than the file's default 1,
   because these render at exactly 20px, where a 1px stroke is
   one device pixel and half-disappears against the composer's
   mesh. Same drawing, at a weight that survives it.

/* ============================================================
   THE LOGO AS THREE SEPARATE CHEVRONS

   `TN_MARK` above is the same lockup in one <svg>, and it stays
   — it is what the product draws the logo with anywhere the
   logo is a logo. This is the lockup taken apart, because the
   chat's empty state animates the three arriving one at a time
   (§50.4) and a path inside a shared <svg> cannot be moved
   independently of its siblings without a transform on the
   path, which then has to be composed with the animation's own.
   Three boxes, one path each, is the version with nothing to
   compose.

   THE VIEWBOX IS THE SAME 50 IN ALL THREE, and that is the
   trick that makes this cheap: each chevron keeps the x it has
   in the lockup, so the three stacked on top of each other ARE
   the logo, with no positioning to work out. Only the animation
   moves them.

   Paths are Maryam's `Tn Icon-white for sphere.svg` verbatim.
   `fill` is left to §50, which paints them white.

   THE SECOND FAMILY — PHOSPHOR DUOTONE (MIT), AND IT IS FOR
   ONE SUBJECT

   Maryam, 2 Sep 2026, with a reference of the Points list drawn
   in colour: "not as dry as the other icon library we are
   using". Material Symbols Rounded has no cut that does what
   the reference does — a filled glyph in one hue standing on a
   pale disc of that same hue — so this is a SECOND family,
   deliberately, and the whole of the argument for it is that it
   is scoped to a different KIND of object.

   THE SCOPE IS THE POINTS LIST AND NOTHING ELSE (for now, and
   the next two tabs are the test of whether it holds). Trap 7's
   rule is that holding ONE cut is what makes a set read as a
   system, and that rule is not suspended here — it is answered
   the way `ACH`'s award WebPs already answer it: a thing you WON
   is not a thing you PRESS, and the product has always drawn
   those two registers differently. Every verb and every control
   on this page is still Material. If a Phosphor mark ever turns
   up beside a Material one naming the same object, that is the
   line being crossed.

   MIT, WITH NO ATTRIBUTION REQUIRED, which is why it is this set
   and not Solar (CC BY 4.0) — a client deliverable that has to
   carry a credit line is a licence conversation rather than a
   design decision. `@phosphor-icons/core@2.1.1`, the `duotone`
   assets, pasted rather than redrawn, exactly as `IP` above is
   pasted from google/material-design-icons.

   DUOTONE IS TWO PATHS AND ONE COLOUR. The first path is the
   pale body at `opacity="0.2"`, the second the solid figure;
   both take `currentColor`. That is the whole reason this set
   was chosen over a solid one — a row states ONE hue (`--mk`)
   and gets both tones out of it, so a mark cannot end up with a
   body in one colour and a figure in another, and the drained
   state is a single re-point of that variable rather than a
   second table of greys.

   THE GRID IS 256, NOT MATERIAL'S `0 -960 960 960`, and the
   proxy below states it so no call site has to. Trap 7 is
   explicit that a path in the wrong box renders as an invisible
   speck with nothing thrown, so the two families are addressed
   through two proxies — `I` and `P` — rather than through one
   table that would have to carry a box per entry. `grep
   'viewBox="0 0 256 256"'` should find exactly this file.

   REGRIDDING WAS CONSIDERED AND REFUSED. `talChat` was mapped
   from 24 to the 960 box because it is Maryam's own mark and had
   to join the family it was drawn for. These are somebody else's
   family and are meant to stay one — flattening them into the
   Material box would say they belong to it.
