   MESSAGES, CERTIFICATIONS, AND THE LEADER'S OWN PROFILE

   The last three modules. Two of them are about other people and one is the
   only page on this portal that is about Priya.

   THE BOARD IS THE SAME BOARD, AND IT IS NO LONGER READ FROM HERE. `ROOM` in
   views.js is Cohort 41's discussion; the candidate reads it on their own
   Cohort page and the leader reads the identical thread from the other side, so
   a post made on either portal is on the other the moment the switcher flips.
   That is unchanged. What changed on 2 Sep 2026 is the DOOR: Messages used to
   hold the three cohort boards beside the direct threads, and Maryam took that
   section out ("remove the cohort boards section from messages module"). The
   leader now reads and posts to a board from the cohort's own page, where
   `V.leadCohort`'s Discussion tab draws `discussionRoom()`.
   ========================================================================== */

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE OTHER TWO BOARDS — KEPT, AND CURRENTLY UNREAD

   Cohort 33 is in week 11 and its board sounds like it: people comparing notes
   on the end of the 90 days. Cohort 47 is four days old, so its board is the
   leader's own opening post and one reply — a thin board is the honest drawing
   of a cohort that has barely started.

   THESE TWO HAVE NO READER SINCE 2 Sep 2026 and they are kept anyway, which is
   a deliberate exception to this build's rule about deleting what nothing
   writes. That rule is about RULES and HANDLERS, where an orphan reads as a
   live capability; this is written CONTENT, and deleting nine posts of prose to
   satisfy a lint is a worse trade than leaving them addressable. `ldrBoard` is
   kept with them for the same reason: it is the one line that maps an id onto a
   board, so re-wiring is one edit rather than a rewrite.

   WHERE THEY BELONG IF THEY COME BACK: `V.leadCohort`'s Discussion tab
   (lead2), which today draws `discussionRoom()` for Cohort 41 and an empty
   state for the other two — so those two cohorts are described as empty while
   their boards sit here. Pointing that tab at `ldrBoard(c.id)` is the fix, and
   it needs `discussionRoom` to take its rows as an argument rather than
   closing over `ROOM`.

   Same row shape as `ROOM` — [name, img, initials, body, when, mine] — so
   `roomLine` draws all three without a branch.

   THE LEADER'S ONE-TO-ONE THREADS

   Three candidates, and each thread is about the thing their flag says. The
   candidate side draws its own half of the Priya thread in `V.messages`; this
   is not that thread — Maryam's is with her own leader and Maryam is in
   Cohort 41, so it IS the same relationship. It is left out of this list on
   purpose: the three here are the three the flags said Priya owed a message,
   which is what a leader opens this page to do.

   TOBIAS IS NO LONGER FLAGGED AND HIS THREAD STAYS, which is the right way round
   for an inbox. The attention queue was cut to three on 1 Sep 2026 and he was
   one of the nine who came back — so his thread is now what a resolved one looks
   like: Priya's message four days ago about eight days of silence, and his reply
   two days ago saying he is back and at 35%. A message list that only held
   currently-flagged people would delete its own history every time somebody
   recovered, which is the opposite of what `lnotes` and this page are for.

   CERTIFICATIONS

   WHAT LEADING EARNS, AND IT IS NOT MONEY. This is the module that replaced
   Earnings, and the replacement is the whole argument: a cohort leader
   volunteers, and certifications are how the contribution is recognised. The
   note saying so is the one wireframe note that IS for the leader, so it
   crosses.

   A CERTIFICATION IS A `.cert`, THE COMPONENT THE CANDIDATE GETS AT THE END
   OF A COURSE. Same object, same drawing: a mark, an eyebrow, a name, the
   date and the signature, and something to download. The wireframe drew them
   as a four-column table; a table is right for comparing cohorts and wrong
   for a thing you earned and want to look at.

   THE ONE IN PROGRESS IS NOT A `.cert`, because there is nothing to download
   and a greyed-out certificate is a certificate you have not got. It is a
   requirements list — the three things it takes and which are done — which is
   the only page on this portal that tells the leader what to do next for
   themselves.
   ========================================================================== */

   embedded WebPs `build.py` carries, and the candidate's own tab reads it the
   same way through `certAll`'s `k`. Deriving the key from the name would be a
   string match on product copy — the thing `factIcon`'s `\bstar\b` bug is the
   worked example of, one file over.

   THE CERTIFICATIONS PAGE IS THE CANDIDATE'S, ONE PORTAL OVER — 2 Sep 2026

   `certsTab` (views.js) was rebuilt the same day against two screenshots of a
   Credly profile: a black card headed "Congratulations on your most recent
   certification" holding the badge, the name and the issuer with the two
   controls at the end of the row, then "All certifications" over a grid of
   upright cards. This page had the same content in the shapes that preceded
   it — a `.cert` hero and a `.tile-stack` of `.cardrow`s — so what changes is
   the drawing and not one figure.

   IT IS THE SAME CLASSES, NOT A CALL TO `certHero` / `certGrid`. Both of those
   read `CERT_ART[c.k]` (which crosses) and then do two things that do not: the
   hero's Download is `data-go="transcript"`, a CANDIDATE view, and every grid
   card is a `data-go="transcript"` target. A leader's certificate has no page
   of its own in this build, so the leader's cards are `<div>`s — §60's rule,
   arrived at from the honest side: rather than draw a control that goes
   nowhere, do not draw a control.

   THE HERO IS `.dark-card` AND IT LEADS THE PAGE. It was the third section,
   under the figure band and a `.note`; the reference puts the certification
   first because it is what the page is about, which is also §75's own test for
   who may be black. It is NOT `.cert` any more, and that is the fix for the
   trap the old note here recorded at length: `.cert` is in ai5's `DARK_CARD`,
   so `placeDark` hoisted it into the head band and the page had to be written
   around that. `.dark-card` is in no pass's list, so the card simply stays
   where it is written and the band keeps its own full-width summary.

         settlements on this side of TalentNext.

         WHY IT WAS HERE, so it is not rebuilt by accident: this page replaced
         an Earnings page, and the note was the replacement's explanation of
         itself. "No money anywhere" is one of the four rules the wireframe
         settled for this portal, and a page of certifications standing where a
         balance used to stand is the one place a reader might ask where the
         money went.

         WHY IT CAN GO. Nothing on this portal has said anything about a fee
         for two builds — there is no Earnings slot in the rail, no figure with
         a currency on any leader page — so the note was answering a question
         the product no longer prompts. What it actually asserted survives in
         two places that are not explanations: `V.leadProfile`'s Role row reads
         "Volunteer cohort leader · unpaid", and the figure cell 40px above this
         said "as a volunteer" under Cohorts led. A fact stated in a record beats
         the same fact stated in a panel about the record.

         THE `.note` COMPONENT IS UNTOUCHED and has readers on both portals —

  ${''/* "EARNED" IS "ALL CERTIFICATIONS" AND ITS ROWS ARE CARDS. The list was

         end — and the candidate tab's own note is why that shape lost: the
         badge IS the object rather than an icon standing in for it, and a 40px
         slot cannot hold a 90px disc with type around its rim.
         TWO THINGS WENT WITH THE ROW AND NEITHER IS A LOSS. The "Active" tag

         explaining what "reviewed" means. It was the longest block on the page

/* ==========================================================================
   THE LEADER'S PROFILE

   THE MONEY PROBLEM, STATED. Priya is in `AGENTS` on the candidate side with
   a price of $95, because as a TALENT AGENT she is paid for a 45-minute
   interview. As a COHORT LEADER she volunteers. Both are true of the same
   person and the wireframe never had to face it, because its leader was a
   different human from any of its agents.

   So this page does NOT draw `agentCardH('priya')`, which would be the neat
   reuse: that component prints `a.price`, and a fee on the volunteer portal
   would contradict the rule lead.js is built on in the one place a leader
   looks at themselves. What it draws instead is the part of the public listing
   that IS about leading — the rating, the cohorts, the range and the bio — and
   it says which of the two roles the page is about.

   AND SINCE 1 SEP 2026 THE SEPARATION IS THE WHOLE PAGE, NOT A CAVEAT ON IT.
   A cohort leader does not interview, so three things on this page were the
   agent's record standing on the volunteer's page: "62 interviews" on the
   public card and again under Your standing, a 45-minute "session length", and
   an availability calendar whose entire purpose was letting candidates book an
   interview. Each is replaced by the leading equivalent rather than deleted,
   because the page still has to answer the same four questions — who you are,
   what candidates see, when you are on, and how you are measured.

   EDITING IS A SHEET, READING IS THE PAGE. Same shape as the candidate's own
   Profile: `.idhead` with the photo, a `.tile` of `.kv` rows for what is set,
   and an Edit control on the row it edits (§29.10). A page of live inputs
   would be the wireframe's drawing, and this product does not have one.

   AND IT IS TWO TABS SINCE 2 SEP 2026 — General Profile and Public Profile
   (Maryam: "this page should have 2 tabs right after the summary section …
   divide the content in both profile tabs accordingly").

   THE LINE BETWEEN THEM IS *WHO THE BLOCK IS FOR*, which this page had already
   half-drawn: "What candidates see" is a section whose whole heading is that
   distinction, and every note above about the money problem is the same
   question asked once. **Public is what a candidate reads when they choose you.
   General is the account behind it — nobody else ever sees a line of it.**

     Public   the card, the bio, the three listing fields that MAKE the card
              (specialism, assessing range, call length), and Your standing —
              the four figures the card's "4.9 · 8 cohorts led" is the summary of
     General  who you are and how to reach you, when you are on, who reviews
              you, and what you are told about

   THE `.kv` TILE IS THE ONE BLOCK THAT HAD TO BE CUT IN TWO, and the cut is not
   arbitrary — it is the EDIT SHEET's own list. `ldrProfileSheet` edits display
   name, specialism, bio and call length, and four of those five rows are
   therefore listing copy; only Role is a fact about the account. So General
   keeps Display name and Role, and Public takes Specialism, Assessing range and
   Call length under a heading that says what they are for. A reader who wants
   to change the bio and a reader who wants to change their notifications were
   being sent to the same undifferentiated tile.

   YOUR STANDING GOES PUBLIC AND THAT IS THE ONE JUDGEMENT WORTH ARGUING. It is
   headed "Read-only · across every cohort you have closed", which sounds like a
   private performance record — but 4.9 and "8 cohorts led" are printed on the
   card 200px above it, so the section is the working behind two numbers a
   candidate is already reading. On the General tab it would be the only block
   there that somebody else can see.

   THE STRIP IS `.sec.sec-cs` + `.cs`, WHICH IS `V.leadReports`' OWN SHAPE —
   §16 zeroes a section holding a tab strip and §20 knows the marker, so the
   two grounds meet on one line with no rule of its own. It sits directly after
   `ph()` so it is the first thing under the head band, which is what "right
   after the summary section" names: `placeBand`'s run walks forward from the
   `.ph` taking Tal's card, the ask line and any declared `.head-sec`, and a
   plain `.sec` is none of those — so the run stops HERE and the band closes
   above the tabs rather than swallowing them.

/* THE WEEKLY-CALLS SHEET IS DELETED — `ldrAvailSheet`, `ldrDays` and
   `LDR_DAY_NAMES` with it (Maryam, 2 Sep 2026: "a cohort leader can not
   reschedule a weekly call so remove that flow").

   IT WAS A WEEK OF `.tg` TOGGLES, one row per weekday, each cohort's hour read
   off `LEAD_COHORTS` so the sheet could not drift from the three other surfaces
   that state the same string — and its own helper line is the sentence that
   ended it: "moving one moves it for every candidate in that cohort, so the
   change is announced on their board." A control that reschedules ten people's
   week is not a leader's, which is the same boundary 1 Sep drew when the level
   decision came off this portal.

   THE DERIVATION IS WORTH KEEPING IN WORDS, because the next sheet that lists a
   leader's week will want it: the day column was `c.call.split(' ')[0]` rather
   than a typed list, after this sheet had already drifted once — its Monday row
   said "Cohort 47 call at 6:00 PM" while `LEAD_COHORTS[2].call` said the same
   thing in two other places. `lcall` / `lcTitle` / `lcDetail` in lead.js are
   that rule as it survives, with three readers each.

   `S.ldrAvail`, THE `data-ldravail` BRANCH AND THE `'avail'` CLOSE BRANCH GO
   TOO, and so do both call sites — the Calls page's Reschedule (lead3) and this
   page's own Manage row. A sheet nothing opens is the "gate nothing writes"
   tell one level up. `.tg` / `.sw` are untouched: the notification switches
   three sections above are the component's real caller. */

     CONTACT A CANDIDATE BY NAME — `data-ldrdm`
     Maryam, 1 Sep 2026: the attention queue's last column "takes the user on
     the direct chat with that candidate on click".

     IT RESOLVES A NAME, NOT AN INDEX, and that is the whole reason it is a
     function rather than a `data-ldrth`. `LDR_THREADS` is an inbox in
     most-recent order — the note over it says so, and Tobias is in it because a
     resolved thread keeps its history — so an index written into the attention
     table would point at whoever happened to be third the day it was written.
     The queue is derived from `lflag` and the inbox is not, so the only stable
     thing the two share is the person.

     A CANDIDATE WITH NO THREAD GETS AN EMPTY ONE, WHICH IS THE POINT. Two of
     the three flagged candidates have been written to and Chloe Ferreira has
     not, so the alternatives were to leave her button dead — §60's dead control
     on a live surface — or to write her a conversation, which is inventing the
     product copy §74 rules out. An empty thread is neither: it is what "you
     have not messaged her yet" actually looks like, and `V.leadMessages` draws
     it (three readers guard for it, see the note on `unread`).

     THE FACE AND THE COHORT COME OFF THE MEMBER RECORD, never typed here —
     `lmembers()` is the same walk the queue itself is built from, so the
     initials, the photograph and the cohort number in the thread header are the
     ones the roster shows. A name that is in no cohort simply does not
     navigate, rather than opening a thread with somebody who does not exist.

     IT NAVIGATES ITSELF because it has two things to set that `data-go` cannot
     carry — the tab and the person. `S.ldrThOpen` is `true` for the same reason
     the row-press sets it: below 900 the list and the thread are two screens,
     and arriving on the list having asked for one person is a press wasted.

   THE THREAD OPENS AT ITS FOOT — `ldrPinThread`
   Maryam, 2 Sep 2026: "the latest one appears at the bottom".

   §36.18b's `margin-top:auto` answers a SHORT thread — the messages sit on the
   composer instead of floating at the top of an empty pane. It cannot answer a
   long one: once the content is taller than the scroller, a fresh `scrollTop`
   of 0 shows the OLDEST message and the newest is below the fold. One line of
   geometry, after the paint.

   IT IS NOT `scrollIntoView` AND NOT `behavior:'smooth'`. The pane is inside
   `#device`, which is itself a scroller inside a scaled frame, and
   `scrollIntoView` walks every ancestor — it scrolls the page as well as the
   thread, so opening Messages jumped the whole app down. Setting `scrollTop` on
   the one element moves the one element. Smooth would animate on every render,
   including the render that only moved a class.

   RUN AFTER `_baseLead`, NOT INSIDE A VIEW, because `render()` replaces
   `device.innerHTML` and the element this measures does not exist until it has.
   Wrapping is lead.js's own idiom for the same reason `leadStick` is wrapped
   there, and this file is parsed after it, so the wrapper composes rather than
   competing.

   NO STICK-TO-BOTTOM STATE, unlike ai3's thread pin. That one tracks whether
   the reader has scrolled up so an arriving message does not yank them back;
   here every render is a navigation or a sent message — both of which SHOULD
   land at the foot — and there is no background arrival to fight with.
