/* ==========================================================================
   BOOKING AN INTERVIEW WITHOUT LEAVING THE CONVERSATION

   Tal could already TALK about booking — "three agents assess at your level"
   — and then had to hand you off: a chip, a page, a rail, four screens. The
   one thing a candidate comes here to do was the one thing the assistant
   could not finish. This pass finishes it. Ask Tal to book an interview and
   the whole flow happens inside the thread: the shortlist, a profile, the day
   and the time, the confirmation. The fee is Stripe's, on Stripe's own page,
   so there is no payment screen here — see the note over `BKW`. When you
   press back, the product behind the conversation has an interview booked.

   FOUR RULES THIS FILE IS BUILT ON, each of them learnt the hard way from
   the surface it is building on.

   1. NOTHING IN A BUBBLE MAY HOLD ITS OWN STATE. The base render replaces
      `device.innerHTML` outright and `placeAsk` (ai4) rebuilds the whole
      `.ask-page` from `S.thread` every time — so a `.on` class put on a slot
      button by a click handler is gone by the next paint. Every widget here
      is therefore a PURE FUNCTION OF `S.bk`, re-run on each render by
      `placeBook`. The thread stores an empty host element, never the drawn
      widget:

        S.thread.push({who:'tal', html: '<div class="bkw" data-bkw="sched">'})

      `placeBook` fills each host from `BKW[name]()`. This is why the day you
      picked survives asking Tal something else in the middle of the flow.

   2. IT IS THE PRODUCT'S OWN UI, NOT A CHAT-SIZED COPY OF IT. `.agh.agh-book`
      is the agent card off the agents page, `.agid` is the profile header,
      `.daystrip`/`.slots` is the picker off the agent page, `.cardrow` is the
      saved card off Payments, `.note.succ` is the confirmation off the
      booking screen. All of it renders in the thread because `.ask-page`
      carries `.page` — every `.app .page ...` rule in the sheet reaches
      inside a bubble already. §35 only pays for what the bubble changes:
      the page gutters those components assume, and the width of a bubble
      that has a card in it.

   3. NO TAL MARK ON A CARD INSIDE TAL. `agentCardH` prints a `talStar` —
      "Ask Tal about this agent" — which is exactly right on the agents page
      and absurd two inches under Tal's own name. The card here is that card
      minus the star, and the space the star held goes to the Book button.

   4. WHAT YOU CHOSE IS WHAT THE PROTOTYPE THEN SHOWS. The booked stage was
      written as fixed prose — Priya Nair, Thursday 20 August, 6:30 PM, $95 —
      because until now nothing could choose otherwise. Book Owen at 2:00 PM
      and every one of those surfaces has to agree, or the flow reads as a
      demo that was not connected to anything. `S.booking` is the record and
      `bkStamp` is what makes the four surfaces read it. See §4 below.
   ========================================================================== */

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. WHAT THERE IS TO CHOOSE

   The five days and six times are `V.agent`'s, character for character, and
   the two disabled slots are its two — this is the same picker, not a second
   one that happens to look similar. The default landing (Thursday the 20th,
   6:30 PM) is the booking the rest of the prototype was written around, so
   somebody who takes the offered slot ends up in exactly the state the
   hand-written booked stage describes.

   The shortlist is the three agents the agents page rails and the `new`
   dashboard rails: the ones who assess at Explorer level with a slot inside
   seven days. `AGENTS` holds five; the other two assess higher bands.

   2. THE WIDGETS

   One entry per step, each a function of `S.bk` and nothing else. A widget
   whose step is settled goes read-only rather than disappearing: the thread is
   a record of what you did, and a live "Continue" under a booking that already
   exists is an invitation to make a second one.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/* THE SHORTLIST, AND THE PROFILE, ARE ONE WIDGET IN TWO STATES.
   Opening an agent could have pushed a new Tal turn instead, and that is the
   wrong model twice over: reading a profile is not something you said, and
   going back to the list would then mean printing the list a second time. It
   is one card that turns over — which is also what "and go back to all
   agents" asks for. `S.bk.open` is which side is up. */
/* THERE IS NO PAYMENT WIDGET, AND THAT IS A PRODUCT DECISION RATHER THAN AN
   OMISSION. The fee is taken by Stripe, on Stripe's own hosted page, so a card
   form drawn here would be a screen the product does not have — and a
   convincing fake of a payment form is the one thing a prototype should never
   put in front of a candidate. `Continue to payment` is the handoff: in the
   product it opens Stripe, and what comes back is the booking. The flow
   therefore has three steps, not four, and the button's reply is the
   confirmation. `bkBooked` records the saved card because that is what the
   product's own receipt row and Payments module already say. */

};

/* THE CONFIRMATION IS THE ONE WIDGET THAT IS NOT A HOST.
   Every other step is live because it can still change — you can turn the
   card over, pick a different day, switch card. A confirmation cannot: it is
   the record of something that happened, and the moment it re-derives itself
   from `S.booking` it stops being that. Book a second interview later in the
   same thread and the first confirmation would silently become a description
   of the second one, or — while the second flow is still mid-way — of nothing
   at all. So it is drawn once and frozen into the message. `.bkw` with no
   `data-bkw` still gets §35's width; `placeBook` has nothing to fill. */

   §07 leaves it a stack below that. Writing my own breakpoint would be a
   second copy of that decision, and the two would drift the first time the
   dashboard's rail changed. Borrowing the container means the cards in the
   chat break to three-up at exactly the width the dashboard's do, and look
   the same when they get there. §35.1 pays the wrapper's page indent. */

   `bkTurn` is a deliberate second path alongside `talPump`: the router
   answers a QUESTION, and these are answers to a BUTTON, where there is
   nothing to route and the reply is already known. It borrows the pump's
   timing so a pressed button and a typed question feel like the same
   assistant, and it reads `talQueue` on the way out so a question asked
   mid-flow still gets its own turn afterwards.

                  moving a booking you already have falls through to the

   flow and must not throw the candidate back to week zero, so `booked` is
   set only from the four stages before it. Everywhere else the booking is
   recorded and the stage is left alone.

   It moves where BACK goes. `S.askFrom` was the page you opened Tal on —
   `agents`, or the dashboard of a stage that no longer exists. The
   conversation now ends somewhere else, and the header says so before you
   press it.

   4. THE PROTOTYPE BEHIND THE CONVERSATION AGREES WITH IT

   The booked stage names its agent and its slot in six places, all of them
   written as prose before anything could choose otherwise: the dashboard
   plate, the "where you are" stepper, the Scheduled tile on Interviews, the
   booking confirmation, the receipt row on Payments, and Tal's own page
   summaries. Leave them and the flow is a demo that ends in a screen about
   somebody else's interview.

   A DOM PASS RATHER THAN SIX REWRITTEN VIEWS, and the reason is the same one
   `placePageSummary` gives for its own: `V.dashboard` is one function with a
   branch per stage, and copying it here to change two spans would fork the
   dashboard. Every step below is guarded and keyed on STRUCTURE — the class
   the view prints, or the label in the key column — so a view that changes
   shape loses the correction rather than getting a broken one. It runs only
   at the booked stage and only once something has actually been booked, so
   the hand-written stage is untouched until the flow has been through it.

   AND THE THREAD HAS TO STAY WHERE IT WAS

   `askSync` (ai4) scrolls the thread to the bottom after every build, which is
   right for a conversation: something was said and the new thing is at the
   end. It is wrong for a widget, twice over.

   Pressing a slot says nothing. The thread is the same length it was a moment
   ago and the only thing that changed is inside a bubble you were already
   looking at — so being moved at all is the surface telling you something
   arrived when nothing did. Below, an unchanged thread keeps its exact
   scroll position.

   And when a turn DOES arrive carrying a widget, ai4's scroll misses it:
   `askSync` runs inside the base render and this pass fills the hosts after
   it, so the smooth scroll it starts is aimed at a height the page had before
   the widget was in it — it glides to what was the bottom and stops several
   hundred pixels short. The instant pin below is measured after the fill, so
   it lands.

   Gated on there being a widget in the thread at all: every other
   conversation keeps ai4's behaviour, smooth scroll included. */
